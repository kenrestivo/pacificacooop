TODO testing stuff

figure out how to assert tests on non-wtc html: i.e. the validateresp
	or, just use a plain ol' regexp!
	how do they work in skij though?

finally we get to the "basic" stuff
	edit a record 
		HOOKS FOR OTHER STUFF. so i can test linked records too
	delete a record (with and without cancelling)
	as privileged user and as non-privileged user

i'll need to do this as a couple users, just to make sure
	go through the database and do all links as all *real* users?

harder:
	add a record (with and without errors)
	with errors for editing

then, post the pages to the validator
	try mike's code
		so far so good
	somehow capture the results, saving them somewhere
		files? db?
	it does write-char... i don't like that
		some way to capture it to a file?
	is there any way to get status codes back from the validator?
		only save the errors
		be sure to include the source and dom tree
	<h2 id="result" class="valid">

how to navigate links?
	find the right table
	find the right row/col.
	find the right link
	click on it!

go back and have a look at my test plan!
ok, the basics: login, etc.
	hmm. how to look at tables? i can only identify them by ID? 
		that sucks 
ok, this rules!
	shall i assert the page BEFORE entering data, or afterwards?
		i.e. in login stuff.
auugh. ANNOYANCES with jwebunit:
	ok, how to check TABLES!?? i need to understand that
		it wants ID's FOR EVERYTHING and/or "summaries". what's that???
	webtestcase.webtester.httpunitdialog.webconversation.getcurrentpage(webresponse!).getTables
		this SHOULD be in httpunit docs!!!
		webresponse:
			or, getfirstmatchingtable, gettablestartingwith
		hmm. webtable class has getid. null? getsummary.. null?
getrowcount
nice! asText() attribute returns a VECTOR OF VECTORS of scheme strings!
	then vector-ref, vector-length
ok... LINKS
	damn weblink object. this object shit is annoying.
		asText, or getParameterNames, or getURLString
write a get-link-by(text,url,parameter) function
	so i can CLICK on the  bastard and get to the next step!!

start with REALLY simple shit
	go through all the links from the main page
	and make sure they WORK. i.e. i get an html at the end
		useful for checking for WARNINGS
