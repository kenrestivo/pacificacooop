TODO testing stuff


go back and have a look at my test plan!
ok, the basics: login, etc.
	hmm. how to look at tables? i can only identify them by ID? 
		that sucks 
ok, this rules!
	shall i assert the page BEFORE entering data, or afterwards?
		i.e. in login stuff.
auugh. ANNOYANCES with jwebunit:
	ok, how to check TABLES!?? i need to understand that
		it wants ID's FOR EVERYTHING and/or "summaries". what's that???
	webtestcase.webtester.httpunitdialog.webconversation.getcurrentpage(webresponse!).getTables
		this SHOULD be in httpunit docs!!!
		webresponse:
			or, getfirstmatchingtable, gettablestartingwith
		hmm. webtable class has getid. null? getsummary.. null?
getrowcount
nice! asText() attribute returns a VECTOR OF VECTORS of scheme strings!
	then vector-ref, vector-length
ok... LINKS
	damn weblink object. this object shit is annoying.
		asText, or getParameterNames, or getURLString
write a get-link-by(text,url,parameter) function
	so i can CLICK on the  bastard and get to the next step!!
