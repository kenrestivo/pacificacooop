			NEED WEB FORM NOW
		corporate donations, soliciting team volunteers
			possible next web-form project, after 10-names is done
	donation items
		3x5 cards, describe the items
		would be useful to have this in centralised db too. 
		unique id for families is essential
	tracking
		checks, donations, 10 names status (# tickets, $ donated, etc.)


10 names db
	"flawless"
