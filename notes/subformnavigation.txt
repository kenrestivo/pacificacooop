notes on subform navigation, flipping between screens

ok i notice something odd. i'm pushing the TO DO item,
	i should be pushing the LAST item
	if there is anything on the stack, use that INSTEAD OF REQUEST!
		handling auto-fillign the added sub-added item will be interesting
			maybe let it override?
	so how do i pop?
		they are the same thing. think of them as one.
	if i'm supposed to push, i save PREVIOUS LAST onto stack
		i save my current into last
		i also need to save my FORM VARS
			how to do that? it's a selfurl... it's not a save
				make it a save button then
	if no push, i look on stack
		if there's something there, i pop that and save those into last
		and last is what i then use instead of request


i can now go bopping around to different things!
	at page load, if there is anything on the stack, pop it, use that


	at validate time, simulate a page load, remember i'm not using header
	how to deal with edit? i'll have an id in there. will it be on the stack?



	aha. it doesn't push the LAST one, just the CURRENT onw







	might even have a cool javascript edit thing, to go EDIT one that is shown
	hmm, i have to know what table i came from if i'm going to push
	put "push" into ALL menu and recordbuttons IFF there is a parencot


	this is pretty straightforwards for views, which only go one way

	qf issues:









	nice thing is, then a wizard just becomes a custom QF, a collection of links
