notes on subform navigation, flipping between screens


put in a "entry successful" message.
	now, that's not easy.
	save result. check result in gaspacho
		also check result in form-- if add
	wipe result
    if i save result in last, then when i pop off, last gets clobbered
    	including its result. shit.
    	unless i save last when i pop off
			maybe i don't pop off! i do it automatically at reload time?



make the push a button, or a javascript submit
	look at my old subform patch?
	then, save the value of vars at push time
	change my link to a javascript submit or a actual button
		see the old subform shit for reference
	save submitvars into last, then do the PUSH!
		where to do this?! right now i do push nowhere near form
		save them into last-pushed stack?
  save the status of what i was working on!
  	instead of a link, make the push button a submit with a temp set
  		only exportvalues? or submitvars (note the crosslinks!)
  	don't validate if i am saving!
  
  
stack stuff
	i can get a constipated stack. how to cleanse?


well first of all, THE VIEW/DETAILS SHOUDL PUSH!
	the recordbuttons (not actiondbuttons) should all be pushers.
		EXCEPT when they're on their own page, i.e. at top
	wait, why not actionbuttons too? if they are in a details view!





	if i'm supposed to push, i save PREVIOUS LAST onto stack
		i save my current into last
		i also need to save my FORM VARS
			how to do that? it's a selfurl... it's not a save
				make it a save button then





	might even have a cool javascript edit thing, to go EDIT one that is shown
		in a popup. then come back.
			s/b easy, actually.

	hmm, i have to know what table i came from if i'm going to push
	put "push" into ALL menu and recordbuttons IFF there is a parencot


	this is pretty straightforwards for views, which only go one way









	nice thing is, then a wizard just becomes a custom QF, a collection of links
