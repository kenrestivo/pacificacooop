notes on subform navigation, flipping between screens


big question: if i json it, how do i deal with input validation?
	unless i do the html-ajax approach, and submit the subform
	i think i'm really in html-ajax land here.

stack stuff
	i can get a constipated stack. how to cleanse?
	should hitting the index page wipe out the stack?


?? PHP
make the push a button, or a javascript submit
	look at my old subform patch?
	then, save the value of vars at push time
	change my link to a javascript submit or a actual button
		see the old subform shit for reference
	save submitvars into last, then do the PUSH!
		where to do this?! right now i do push nowhere near form
		save them into last-pushed stack?
  save the status of what i was working on!
  	instead of a link, make the push button a submit with a temp set
  		only exportvalues? or submitvars (note the crosslinks!)
  	don't validate if i am saving!
  
  

well first of all, THE VIEW/DETAILS SHOUDL PUSH!
	the recordbuttons (not actiondbuttons) should all be pushers.
		EXCEPT when they're on their own page, i.e. at top
	wait, why not actionbuttons too? if they are in a details view!





	if i'm supposed to push, i save PREVIOUS LAST onto stack
		i save my current into last
		i also need to save my FORM VARS
			how to do that? it's a selfurl... it's not a save
				make it a save button then



???PHP JSON-RPC
	do the jsonclass: hint, for all objects!
		aha! it's a path to the class, useful for python
		jsonrpcObj.__proto__ = (new Error).__proto__ seems to do 
 		jsonrpcObj.__proto__ = Error.prototype
			look at how jsolait does it too. and/or htmlajax
	what about this stdclass thing? i'm not big on that.
		also what with the rpclib and syslib stuff?
	try json'ing the subforms now
		simply return the html, swap out what's there



	might even have a cool javascript edit thing, to go EDIT one that is shown
		in a popup. then come back.
			s/b easy, actually.

	hmm, i have to know what table i came from if i'm going to push
	put "push" into ALL menu and recordbuttons IFF there is a parencot


	this is pretty straightforwards for views, which only go one way









	nice thing is, then a wizard just becomes a custom QF, a collection of links
