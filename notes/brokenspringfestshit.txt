broken springfest items


auction purchases
	one big thing:
		first enter check.
			once it is entered, freeze it or htable it
				with an edit button, for future edits
				how to know?
		then enter a bunch of paddles
			trick is how to show that shit
			same problem as above
			naw, use my multi-select thing!
		for each paddle, list of items
			AND PURCHASE PRICE! that's the kicker
		action? the nextaction on all the subs go back to top?
			do frozens include hidden? or not?
	
	it's a fucking wizard again!
		check
		paddle
		items

		details-style?
			list all the auction purchases for this
				with edit/delete
			and a new button pre-populated with income
		my ugly all-forms-together?
			use the fact that some fields overlap
			naw, won't work for multiples.

the manual entry of the OTHER paddles
	text file homeboy, or, a simple gui with ugly back-end
	have a look at the actual data first. see what you need.

			paddle number(s)
				package number and price
	ROSTER WIZARD

		then branch do the ticket/rsvp wizard!
		don't create a new paddle if one's already provided
	TICKET WIZARD

			different entry point into the beast
	RSVP WIZARD
		enter lead_id
			or pick from db!!
			and perform actions on it: DNC, edit
