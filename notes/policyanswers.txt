Stangeland and the rest of the Ticket Committee can enter CASH, and also LOCATIONS. The Surfboard people can enter LOCATIONS, but not cash. This is all very easy to change if need be.

Ferris and Klyver can enter SOLICITATION checks. Only Klyver can enter FAMILY checkes. If you want to delegate to others too, it's very easy to do.

The system will allow anyone with solicitation privileges to place an ad insertion order. But only Ferris and Klyver can enter checks to pay them off, and make them "valid". Since probably only Ferris will be entering ANYTHING anyway, this is OK. Checks can be assigned to pay off ads. I'll create a screen for the program people that only shows PAID ads, so the program people will only know about the ones that are "real".

I'll assume from our conversation that the Solicitation people won't be doing much entering anyway, it'll probably all fall on Danielle to deal with this. If at any time you want to open up Solicitation entries to the whole membership, just say so, it's easy to do.
