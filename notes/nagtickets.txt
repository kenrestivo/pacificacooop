I fixed the nag report so that it totals up ALL the auction donations for a family: not just what they "donated" but also what they "solicited". It's all one number, and they shouldn't show up on the nag report if they solicited OR donated >$50 of stuff. Next I'll combine the "missing" columns too.

If you show all families, it totals each family so you can see their relative "performance". I notice that Alarid entered garbage data for the amount on one of their auctions, so the totals are all screwed up. I'll leave that for you and/or Danielle to fix if you want to.

On a separate front, the "Springfest Event Ticket Summary" report is available too. It shows lots of detail for whatever tickets are known-about.

I'm focussing on fixing broken things right now, and it seems even with that I'll be busy up until the event.

As for sponsorships, I'm thinking an approach like the packages or the nag indulgences might be necessary: have the system GUESS who gets sponsorships, but require a human to add/change/delete/confirm manually. Sponsorships are such a big grey area, that I think trying to automate them may fall into the category of "too much automation". There may be too many factors for a computer to do, it may be a human-touch thing.
