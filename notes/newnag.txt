OK the DEV site (http://www.pacificacoop.org/sf-dev/) has an updated nag report that (finally!) uses the auth system.

Changes include:
	- A column for "Solicit Auction Delivery", which I expect the "nag people" are going to want pretty soon. 
	- Replaced the checkbox/refresh combination with a simple link
	- A quick-and-dirty link for you to flip back and forth between the indulgence screens and the nag report.
	- Made the Nag Report available from the main menu (only to those that have privileges of course).
	- Maintained the old "nag.php" method for historical purposes.

I'll need a list of the 'nag people' so that I can make sure they have permissions.

I can try to reach you via phone tomorrow. There's a 90% chance that I'll be working at the school in the morning, for Betsy.

This may be one of those things where you want to sit down at the screen and look at it along with me in "real time".

Nite!
