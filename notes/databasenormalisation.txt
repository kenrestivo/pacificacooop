notes on the database normalisation project


	people merge (after my nested form shit works!!)
		lead/company/parents/kids => people
		auctionmerges: no more solicit vs personal anymore!

	finally drop hte duplicates fields:
		first/last: 
			parents, leads, companycontacts, ins, lic, 
		addresses/phone: 
			leads, companies, families
		orgs/companies:
			leads, companies, flyerlocation, rafflelocation




companies as a linktable. just do it
	my guile script. any other things needed?
	companies are now a linktable. full stop.
	update tables that use it
		auction join
		income join
		contacts (nags)
		flyers
		ads
		in-kind
		attendees
	and.... just about every. single. thing. in. springfest.
		just imagine what that's gonna do to my thankyou notes!
			heh. it'll simplify it

DB CHANGES!
	consolidate companies and leads! and then adjust
		note company_name vs company. auugh.
		then go thru each jointable and backhaul those too
		companies_auctions_join... make it leads_auctions_join
		companies_income_join... make it leads_income_join?
		flyer_deliveries... as if anyone gives a shit.
		really, families are companies,and aprents and kids are people

	converting the old data's gonna be interesting!
		select old, insert into new
			similar to rastaimport: check for dupe's first, otherwise insert
			then get the insert_id from that, and putit back into old!
		so, i'm going to grab families:address, dump it into addresses/sites
			then get the addressid (insert_id) and put it in families:addressid
 
	table changes:
		leads gets renamed to invitations and becomes a join
