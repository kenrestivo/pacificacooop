tree menu

use html_treemenu, it works, it's nice
	

working example http://www.phpguru.org/static/treemenu.html
	with all the proper JS includes


open questions
	how to get the stuff in /usr/share/php/data to the browser?
		look at how html_ajax does it
			they just open it generateClient()
		or just link or copy it, goddammit
	can i do title tags? how? i need them
	what about these extra little thingies?



notes
	other events are possible too, i.e. mouseovers. 
		nice extra events like expand/contract too

debbie's and lisa's idea is excellent: pages for each subitem
	with the old-style front-page menu summaries!
	i.e. instead of a single index page, lots of subindex pages
		which look like the old-style thing with status summaries
