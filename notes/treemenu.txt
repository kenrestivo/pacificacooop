tree menu

how to traverse the html_menu tree, and turn it into a treemenu?!
	for all top nodes
		make a node (with help/title/link if any)
			insert it in the menuobject
		if it has subs,
			push onto stack
			for each sub
				make a node (as above)
				insert the node into the last one on the stack
			then pop back out of stack
	recurse it now!!
		break up into functions
	remember the help text
		ideally also provide links to various help texts too
			create a "help" page, you can link to
				which will have all the sub-items under this one!
		maybe those nifty ajax popups? like in my book thing?

	STUCK: how to get the stuff in /usr/share/php/data to the browser?
		look at how html_ajax does it
			they just open it generateClient()
		or just link or copy it, goddammit
	can i do title tags? how? i need them
	what about these extra little thingies?
		what teh FUCK is an "extra little thingie"??!

debbie's and lisa's idea is excellent: pages for each subitem
	with the old-style front-page menu summaries!
	i.e. instead of a single index page, lots of subindex pages
		which look like the old-style thing with status summaries
			go look at the old code or find a new way to do it
			could use ajax, actually
	still leave that main menu thing on the front page though
		and the listbox at the top of all other pages

	
		


use html_treemenu, it works, it's nice
	well, no, i have to figure out teh DATA stuff
	

working example http://www.phpguru.org/static/treemenu.html
	with all the proper JS includes




notes
	other events are possible too, i.e. mouseovers. 
		nice extra events like expand/contract too
