tree menu

an open all and close all button!
	hmm. how to do that?
	read docs?
	

8 hours PHP		
debbie's and lisa's idea is excellent: pages for each subitem
	with the old-style front-page menu summaries!
	i.e. instead of a single index page, lots of subindex pages
		which look like the old-style thing with status summaries
			go look at the old code or find a new way to do it
			could use ajax, actually
	still leave that main menu thing on the front page though
		and the listbox at the top of all other pages



remember the help text
		ideally also provide links to various help texts too
			create a "help" page, you can link to
				which will have all the sub-items under this one!
		maybe those nifty ajax popups? like in my book thing?

		
other events are possible too, i.e. mouseovers. 
		nice extra events like expand/contract too


maybe stick the listbox at the top of the generic non-menu pages and reports?
