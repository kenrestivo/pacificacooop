debbie's and lisa's idea is excellent: pages for each subitem
	with the old-style front-page menu summaries!
	i.e. instead of a single index page, lots of subindex pages
		which look like the old-style thing with status summaries
			go look at the old code or find a new way to do it
			could use ajax, actually
	still leave that main menu thing on the front page though
		and the listbox at the top of all other pages

	
		


use html_treemenu, it works, it's nice
	well, no, i have to figure out teh DATA stuff
	

working example http://www.phpguru.org/static/treemenu.html
	with all the proper JS includes




notes
	other events are possible too, i.e. mouseovers. 
		nice extra events like expand/contract too
