	drawing the web form DONE

				check that they're less than len or 254 (maybe)
				if not, return an array to display
					copy an empty fields array
					stuff the entered values into =>def
						i'll need to htmlspecialchars() the data first!
					stuff the error description into => error
						and red comments showing what is wrong/missing
			if they are ok, save them! DONE
				send the row array to a save function
					i will need mysql_escape_string() for db insertion!
						or addslashes()

security: http auth
	augh. a complete auth model
		users with userid's
			link to parents, for further auth
			password (md5)
			are users ALWAYS gonna be parents? add password to parents table?
			and username/uid. hmm. 
		a userprivs table (many to many to users and areas)
			various mysql-esque booleans with privs
			view
			add
			delete
			edit
			what about su?
				what if i want to have su privs, just view. or just add?
				specifically, privs to edit user privs?
		an area or domain or realm
			"area" being, things. 
				10names
				money
				3x5 (text, not money)
				what else?
		ah! uid/realm/compennt/instance/level!
			nifty.
		ugh. if i am truly going to have secure keys, i need a SESSION table
			with randumb number, used for auth'ing actions.
			for super security, regenerate this randumb number for each action
	http auth "login", and a token that gets passed around!
		let's try it as a function, on the money page. no login, no dice.
		footer: a "logged in as" and/or "log out" on every page!
		i want to do auth ONCE, then pass SOMETHING around../
			but WHAT?
				have a look at nfsn.com
				have a look at pedanticnuke
	ah, at some time, an interface for managing user privs!



Basically, it'll be something similar to your report, 			
	but with a FORM on each line, 
		each containing an EDIT button 
			and a hellacious number of hidden fields. 
		That FORM's action would just call the 
			entry screen, and, as if by magick, 
				the user should see all the values 
				pre-populated and ready for editing. 
		A DELETE button could sit in that FORM too, 
			and the main loop would then call a new delete function, 
				possibly throwing up an "are you sure" beforehand....  
					no rest for the wicked.
		The main loop would, 
		if it sees "edit", call the save function with a (new) arg, 
			so that it knows that we're changing not saving, 
			and can conditionally use "update" in the SQL query instead of "insert", 
	ah shit. i either need multiple forms to call, or, have a smart form
		that knows whether it's being called to edit, delete, etc
