create a  proper springfest microsite

ok, now do the css
	menu
	floaties

specials:
	home page: list of all the summaries!
	auction page: the list of the packages

	
layout:
    home
    	little blurbs and links to all of below, in order
    event
    	the invitation text, basically
    	pdf of invitation itself
		map to event location
    sponsorship
		sponsorship levels (like my shit from lastyear)
    	pdfs of sponsorship info
    	donate/paypal buttons?
    raffle
    	article and picture of surfboard
	auction items
		the list of fabulous auction items
    about
    	basic info about the school
    
on each page: 	  
	links to donate buttons
	sponsorship blogroll down the side


database-ize this!
	it'll be the same shit every year, so just put it in the system
	i'll want to keep previous years for history purposes
	pages are just a joinfield
		home,event,sponnsorship,raffle, auction, about
	fields/tables for each "page"
		foreignkey popup of which page
		text (short)		
		text (extended)
			handle it like a blog entry, two fields on one page
		attachments/links
	include edit links if cookie'ed and permitted

use phptal for this beast
	
then enter the crap for previous years, from OLD directory on public website

	
each year, update script
	copy/paste from previous year, mostly




multi-user self-editing is pretty much stuck behind the ibrowser in tinymce
	get that working, and you're ready to go with this
