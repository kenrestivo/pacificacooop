create a  proper springfest microsite


database-ize this!
	pages table-- one for each page:
		shorturl fragment
		menu short name-- display
		class?! or use shorturl?
			i.e. dispatch to a subclass based on name
		different each schoolyear too... remmeber to put in new year!
			pre-insert "nothing here yet" if nothing there
		htmltext (short)		
		htmltext (extended)
			handle it like a dkos blog entry, two editors on one page
	attachments/links table? or let it go in freeform?
	some will be SPECIAL, like, always required
		auction
		home
		solicit
		about

specials, in addition to the stuff in the text boxin:
	home page: list of all the summaries!
		crap. might have to use METAL here for this one
	event page: purchase ticket interface
	auction page: the list of the packages
	about page: previous years's springfests links.. any past pages or data
	sponsorship page showing ad prices from database
		and link to paypal purchase
		

include edit links in template, if cookie'ed and permitted


the sponsors show up on every page, go do that
	
ok, now abstract all this out somehow
	one big class for The Whole Thing
	functions for each //// item
	possibly a dispatcher



		
layout:
    home
    	little blurbs and links to all of below, in order
    event
    	the invitation text, basically
    	pdf of invitation itself
		map to event location
    sponsorship
		sponsorship levels (like my shit from lastyear)
    	pdfs of sponsorship info
    	donate/paypal buttons?
    raffle
    	article and picture of surfboard
	auction items
		the list of fabulous auction items
    about
    	basic info about the school
    
on each page: 	  
	links to donate buttons
	sponsorship blogroll down the side


	
then enter the crap for previous years, from OLD directory on public website

	
each year, update script
	copy/paste from previous year, mostly


multi-user self-editing is pretty much stuck behind the ibrowser in tinymce
	get that working, and you're ready to go with this

the schoolyear constraint is a miserable hack, go fix

$! how? htmlentities?
