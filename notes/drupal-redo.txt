redo the whole site in drupal or xoops or something


differences between my app and drupal?
	auth the concept of group-level privs:
			being able to do x/y/z to OTHER people's data
		i think i saw this somethere
	linkconcat and popup and searchselect
	the wide variety of tables


open questions
	does it use templates? how can i use templates?
	can i set a popup/pulldown to be items from another node type??
	can i have user names with spaces in them?
	password recovery.. make sure it handles this
	how can i glue between my old application and the new one?
		i.e. mix drupal nodes and coop stuff
		figure out how to integrate this massive app base already present
		look at civic-crm? a big beast in and of itself
		each table is a node? i.e. custom content type?
			i.e. subscription? calendar?
	integrating menu, how?
		shouldn't be that difficult: custom menu basically
		already has its own heirarchal stuff
	linking auth with family name/id
		familyid is *everywhere* in this app... s/b userid?
			i.e. more than one user per family?
			teachers!!?


plan for new site:
	new users get EMAILED their password and login name!!
		none of this pop-up-menu crapola!
