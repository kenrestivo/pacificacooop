redo the whole site in drupal or xoops or something

first drop all the crufty crap cleanup stuff

wow, i was able to get all the content in there!! cool!

modules i'll want for the school
	must have
		civicrm, of course!
		civimail (instead of bbs?)
     	calendar/event, i.e. food site
		minutes!
		event repeat
		tinymce
		flexinode
     	simplevote/mediumvote?
     	amazon associate tools
		gallery
		print friendly
	ooh!
		activeselect: may be useful!
		blockbar
		mailhandler? for posting?
		project!
		javascripttools
	hmm? research more
		nice menus?
		category?
		contact list
		img_assist?

		
use the files/foo stuff for andreas theme! make it all in drupal!
		
try to bridge it in
	make my stuff a subset, replace dispatcher/generic.php
	

			

find a choose widget for linked tables
	
step through every section of the site, and look at what's required
	invitations: inviting versus names? pick list? tricky.
	the tangle of membership, enhancement, etc
		just add some of it as adjuncts to user information
			or glue it in somehow
	

differences between my app and drupal?
	auth the concept of group-level privs:
			being able to do x/y/z to OTHER people's data
		i think i saw this somethere
	linkconcat and popup and searchselect
	the wide variety of tables
	
open questions
	does it use templates? how can i use templates?
		it uses its own fucked-up templating engine: PHPTemplate.
	can i set a popup/pulldown to be items from another node type??
		probably not. but there's stuff in civicrm
	how can i glue between my old application and the new one?
		i.e. mix drupal nodes and coop stuff
		figure out how to integrate this massive app base already present
		look at civic-crm? a big beast in and of itself
		each table is a node? i.e. custom content type?
			i.e. subscription? calendar?
	integrating menu, how?
		shouldn't be that difficult: custom menu basically
		already has its own heirarchal stuff
			read docs, yes.
	linking auth with family name/id
		familyid is *everywhere* in this app... s/b userid?
			i.e. more than one user per family?
			teachers!!
		look at member designation in civicrm


plan for new site:
	new users get EMAILED their password and login name!!
		none of this pop-up-menu crapola!




how to start, goddammit!?
	have to move shit around in cvs, no?
	try integrating it without that
	wow, petition module integrates with civicrm really well!
		others do too, i.e. vote module
		
-----------------
DONE

can i have user names with spaces in them?
		yes
	password recovery.. make sure it handles this
		yes

		install mods
				book
	     	forums

drupal settings
	do not let users auto-register
