redo the whole site in drupal or xoops or joomla or something

all the crufty crap cleanup stuff (sep: cleanup.txt?)
	this thing has GOT to survive in its own section

import the users!!
	write an export script using csv python
		drupal file: name, email, password, familyid, userid
			USE THE LIVE DATA! the passwords are bullshit on my home site!
				this presumes pushing it live. am i ready?
 	then do the drupal user import of same data; it should match up
		do i have to write something? or does it exist already?
	finally write another quick python script to replace passwords
		based on email address... scary but it's all i've got


set up forums: member only should see it
	perms? content types? what?		

oh wow, event types! cool, i can filter by those
	content types? where to set those up?
	
modules i'll want for the school
	must have
		tinymce
		gallery2? or image? or does tinyhtml do that anyway? ing_assist?
		print friendly
	i can wait
      	amazon associate tools
	ooh!
		activeselect: may be useful!
		javascripttools! for my custom module things!
		blockbar
		mailhandler? for posting?
		project!
	hmm? research more
		category?
		contact list
		img_assist?
		nice menus? bah, doesn't help
		



ok, how do i do auth now? i no longer link to the users table
	this needs serious thought. integrate with old app
	i think i need to be a module, at least to add the perms in!
		big, massive matrix of perms, too!
		
						


update the "welcome" email, to tell them,
	if they don't like their username, change it!

	
do the dance of the CVS
	should be easy, compared to the clusterfuck i've been dealing with lately
	
	
then push the fucker live!


heh, cool, label printing via fpdf included now!
	angel bueno pardo post to civicrm list

by default, set simple_access defaults so that ALL nodes are members only
	only privileged users can un-do that
	gah! not possible. have to hack


import the solicitation contacts!
	and territories too. custom civicrm stuff!
	

find a way to link the leads to who invited them
	and permission them, so only certain people see them

more importation
	do the 20-year alumni thing. it's time!
	export the solicitation contacts (the most important ones!)
	then the leads


get the paypal SSL cert thing going			
			
			
use the files/foo stuff for andreas theme! make it all in drupal!
		
find a choose widget for linked tables??
	or write your own?

start converting stuff to flexinodes or custom modules
	job descriptions
	enrollment?
	enhancement?
	
step through every section of the site, and look at what's required
	invitations: inviting versus names? pick list? tricky.
	the tangle of membership, enhancement, etc
		just add some of it as adjuncts to user information
			or glue it in somehow
	

differences between my app and drupal?
	auth the concept of group-level privs:
			being able to do x/y/z to OTHER people's data
		i think i saw this somethere
	linkconcat and popup and searchselect
	the wide variety of tables
	
open questions
	does it use templates? how can i use templates?
		it uses its own fucked-up templating engine: PHPTemplate.
	can i set a popup/pulldown to be items from another node type??
		probably not. but there's stuff in civicrm
			yeah, look in modules. you have to write ugly php to do it
	how can i glue between my old application and the new one?
		i.e. mix drupal nodes and coop stuff
		figure out how to integrate this massive app base already present
		look at civic-crm? a big beast in and of itself
		each table is a node? i.e. custom content type?
			i.e. subscription? calendar?
	integrating menu, how?
		shouldn't be that difficult: custom menu basically
		already has its own heirarchal stuff
			read docs, yes.
	linking auth with family name/id
		familyid is *everywhere* in this app... s/b userid?
			i.e. more than one user per family?
			teachers!!
		look at member designation in civicrm


plan for new site:
	new users get EMAILED their password and login name!!
		none of this pop-up-menu crapola!




how to start, goddammit!?
	have to move shit around in cvs, no?
	try integrating it without that
	wow, petition module integrates with civicrm really well!
		others do too, i.e. vote module


----------------
BELOW THE LINE


			have a look at the towncenter one for comparison
			maybe custom data for wait list application?!!
				i'd have to write custom drupal to parse it out
					i.e. to make contacts for parent/child/etc
					easy with javascript kit, repeating forms, flexinode
			add the profiles and custom fields to the thankyou page!



try to shoehorn it in
	update my include path to obviate the need for chdir() shit!
		include the COOP_ABSOLUTE_FILE_PATH
			i need DB_DataObject class_location, schema_loation too!
	make my stuff a module, replace dispatcher/generic.php
		will work for everything except the PDF shit
			should be a way around that, actually!
	make my shitty coopmenu a block, only for registered users
	the include paths are going to be UGLAY!
		because my coop app needs MY pear and local pear!
			but civicrm has its own pear too... conflicts! DB, QF, Pager
			i cannot break civicrm!



				
-----------------
DONE

can i have user names with spaces in them?
		yes
	password recovery.. make sure it handles this
		yes

		install mods
				book
	     	forums

drupal settings
	do not let users auto-register

wow, i was able to get all the content in there!! cool!
			civimail (instead of bbs?)
		civicrm file: family info, familyid, and userid
			parse out if possible
	FIRST import them as civicrm contacts!
		get the family id's correct!
		event repeat
		flexinode
		minutes!
     	calendar/event, i.e. food site
			hmm. permissions for events: some public, some not
			simpleaccess!
