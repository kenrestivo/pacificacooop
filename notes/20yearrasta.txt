the 20 year roster!!


tweeks:
	birthdays need to be y2k'ed (like my old rasta import)
	year attended is fucked. it's yy-yy,yy-yy,yy-yy for each subsequent line
	board positoin is odd but predictabe: TITLE(yy-yy),TITLE(yy-yy)
		also first/1st, second/2nd inconsistency
	assume pacifica unless otherwise noted, i think i have this code somewhere
	ignore the "see" lines
	this is not difficult.
	then make a php or python gui for dupe-fixing



import the bitchen 20-year alumni rasta!
	bummer: lots of work
	first i have to yearify the roster form
		so as to yank edit's out of ALL previous-year enrollments!
	then i have to clean up the spreadsheet
		empty lines are whatever was previous
			do it MANUALLY? there are uglinessen
		fix the 2-digit dates: manually, most likely
			naw. easy in php. explode, then guess > 50 < 50
		make the former-board-member stuff logical: manually? too	
	at import time, need to check for duplicate last-names/family names
		search db first, avoid collisions but also let merges happen!
			soundexes on parent names? auugh.
	i will need to deal with joins here if mult kids!
		basically, if parent lines above are same, use same familyid 
	finally the address hacks from alumni-hack.php
		but different: there are no zipcodes?
	then once it's in, got to reconcile with the "alumni" leads list!
