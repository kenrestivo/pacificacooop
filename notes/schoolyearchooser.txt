schoolyear choooser notes

30 mins
	* the ugliness goes into addandsetvars
		force schoolyear to always be a select
		a function to populate the schoolyears
		use this in coopform
		grab ideas from utils.inc


????
the schoolyear thing. i need a schoolyear chooser, EVERYWHERE.
		make a test, and a test page to see how it'll work
			chooser, and other links too
	ok. i think it's easy. i create a schoolyear GLOBAL, at the top
		it is only shown if yearlevel > whatever is target (view/edit/etc)
		i check it, in view, other places
		i save/restore it from session, and use save/restored version 
			i.e. it sets itself from $cp->vars
			it's its own weirdo form, so it can only work with view then
			BUT, it may be checked by CoopForm/View/Object
		i'll need to calculate it based on all the years present in data
			adding of course this and next year, if not
			and set default to THIS (qf default should work nicely)
			so this thing BELONGS in coopview!
				but... no.the form shit is too scary.
			ok. so i put the *function* in coopview, 
				but i call it from generic?
			so, put it in the OBJECT, but only show it if no parents?
				hack, but gets me through details alive.
			now, in coopform, coopobject, or a new class?
				a customelement. i'll need it in coopform too! for schoolyear
					ooh, this is getting good.
				it'll need to be a coopform subclass
		update any other weirdo chooser i have, to user $cp->vars
			i.e. the chooser in carriereport, or in enhancement
		make sure it maintains state		
			state will go with the TABLE, in page->vars
		have a look through the objects, for linkconstraints
			be sure the linkconstraints will work now
		NOTE duplication between what we're doing here and defaultconstraints
			perhaps i shouldn't be putting this shit in coopview:find?
				it may belong in defaultconstraints instead
		ah. do NOT need a custom element. 
			just a custom way of generating selectoptions	
		cache the thing.
		handling it as a global is gonna be ugly
			when choosing reports, make set schoolyear = getparent's sy!
				which should be set thru the popup
	leads not showing up. see if that's still broken after joins
		it is. i need to add linkconstraints where i *un* constrain it.
	AUUGH! schoolyearifyperms was WRONG. i need to delete all those from the db.
		in seeds
