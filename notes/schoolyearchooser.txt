schoolyear choooser notes

	so that it fuckin SUBMITS!
	ah. i need to onchange, then i need to add teh js
		is there a nice way to do it? or do i HAQUE!

the schoolyear thing. i need a schoolyear chooser, EVERYWHERE.
ok. i think it's easy. i create a schoolyear GLOBAL, at the top
		it is only shown if yearlevel > whatever is target (view/edit/etc)
		i check it, in view, other places
		i save/restore it from session, and use save/restored version 
			i.e. it sets itself from $cp->vars
			it's its own weirdo form, so it can only work with view then
			BUT, it may be checked by CoopForm/View/Object
		update any other weirdo chooser i have, to user $cp->vars
			i.e. the chooser in carriereport, or in enhancement
		make sure it maintains state		
			state will go with the TABLE, in page->vars
		have a look through the objects, for linkconstraints
			be sure the linkconstraints will work now
		NOTE duplication between what we're doing here and defaultconstraints
			perhaps i shouldn't be putting this shit in coopview:find?
				it may belong in defaultconstraints instead
		ah. do NOT need a custom element. 
			just a custom way of generating selectoptions	
		cache the thing.
		handling it as a global is gonna be ugly
			when choosing reports, make set schoolyear = getparent's sy!
				which should be set thru the popup
