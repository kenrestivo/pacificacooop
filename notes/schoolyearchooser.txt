schoolyear choooser notes

2 hours PHP
add an optional $all flag to the schoolyearchooseroptions
	unshift '%' => 'ALL' to it
	everywhere i dick with schoolyear (mostly coopobject?), s/=/like/g
		in all linkconstraints, basically
	test and make sure this works
	i need to change all the if perms<year! i *always* want to check year
		so the user can constrain

1 hour PHP
the most logical place for this is in the $top
	but not injecting it into the object! store it somewhere, chosenschoolyear
	show it inside of the coopview? maybe in the header?
	no wait, it needs to be a global, for the purposes of CROSSLINKS!
		selectboxen
	or, maybe that can be a findTop() kind of thing
		will findtop ALWAYS work?

1 hour PHP
test EVERYTHING


???
	now, globalise it!
		in coopview and/or generic
		use the schoolyear in the chooser, not the one in currentschoolyear?
			or, store this thing in page somewhere instead? chosenschoolyear?

	
	WHERE does this global belong?
		page?
		view? ($top?)
		page->savedvars?



	ok. i think it's easy. i create a schoolyear GLOBAL, at the top
		it is only shown if yearlevel > whatever is target (view/edit/etc)
		i check it, in view, other places
		i save/restore it from session, and use save/restored version 
			i.e. it sets itself from $cp->vars
			it's its own weirdo form, so it can only work with view then
			BUT, it may be checked by CoopForm/View/Object
		update any other weirdo chooser i have, to user $cp->vars
			i.e. the chooser in carriereport, or in enhancement
		make sure it maintains state		
			state will go with the TABLE, in page->vars
		have a look through the objects, for linkconstraints
			be sure the linkconstraints will work now
		NOTE duplication between what we're doing here and defaultconstraints
			perhaps i shouldn't be putting this shit in coopview:find?
				it may belong in defaultconstraints instead
		ah. do NOT need a custom element. 
			just a custom way of generating selectoptions	
		cache the thing.
		handling it as a global is gonna be ugly
			when choosing reports, make set schoolyear = getparent's sy!
				which should be set thru the popup



clean up the shit in solicit summary, make it more generic
	i.e. try it in generic!
