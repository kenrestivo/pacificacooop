schoolyear choooser notes


fix details EVERYWHERE that use currentschoolyear. it's fucked
	i think i broke horiztable: in enrollment anyway
		ONLY in enrollment. straaange
		the OBJECT has the right shit in there, but it's not printing!!?


2 hours PHP
	everywhere i dick with schoolyear (mostly coopobject?), s/=/like/g
		in all linkconstraints, basically
	test and make sure this works
	i need to change all the if perms<year! i *always* want to check year
		so the user can constrain


??? PHP
in details, some details will need to be default ALL, not default this year
	 company, family, leads(people)


ok, when people have no perms, do i force this year, or JUST SHOW NOTHING?
	i like the idea of just showing nothing instead. but how?


1 hour PHP
test EVERYTHING


	go back and fix the choosers in all the rasta areas
		enhancement, 
		job: nobody has multiyear perms.
		 parented attendance: may have collision here with schoolyear?



??? PHP
	when i flip back and forth i'll need to store/recover storevars too
		it'll stay with the top-level object/table


let all members view year for membership! they can see all rastas now


???
	now, globalise it!
		in coopview and/or generic
		use the schoolyear in the chooser, not the one in currentschoolyear?
			or, store this thing in page somewhere instead? chosenschoolyear?

	
	WHERE does this global belong?
		page?
		view? ($top?)
		page->savedvars?



	ok. i think it's easy. i create a schoolyear GLOBAL, at the top
		it is only shown if yearlevel > whatever is target (view/edit/etc)
		i check it, in view, other places
		i save/restore it from session, and use save/restored version 
			i.e. it sets itself from $cp->vars
			it's its own weirdo form, so it can only work with view then
			BUT, it may be checked by CoopForm/View/Object
		update any other weirdo chooser i have, to user $cp->vars
			i.e. the chooser in carriereport, or in enhancement
		make sure it maintains state		
			state will go with the TABLE, in page->vars
		have a look through the objects, for linkconstraints
			be sure the linkconstraints will work now
		NOTE duplication between what we're doing here and defaultconstraints
			perhaps i shouldn't be putting this shit in coopview:find?
				it may belong in defaultconstraints instead
		ah. do NOT need a custom element. 
			just a custom way of generating selectoptions	
		cache the thing.
		handling it as a global is gonna be ugly
			when choosing reports, make set schoolyear = getparent's sy!
				which should be set thru the popup



clean up the shit in solicit summary, make it more generic
	i.e. try it in generic!


???? PHP
	interesting brain-death. in search, i want to know what's already there
		in entry, i *may* want to enter for all possible years
	HOW thefuck can i do that? generate list of years dating back to... when?
