json stuff



how to deal with duplicates?
	guess. then use it instead of inserting?
	this is a bigger problem in ANY record, if i insert a dupe or near dupe
		i should show a choose dialogue!
			a, b, c, or NEW entry

    

make the box bigger
	auto-grow, maybe? js?


maybe render subforms by shipping them (minus their form tags) via json?


		


4 hours javascript/php
json selectbox
	for goodies, a 'details' box next to the select
		showing more info on the selected item, javascript-refreshed
		possibly: on select, show full record in displaybox
			i.e. horiztable

don't let the flexac.css override my font. keep what's already there!
