json select box notes


deal with back/forward push/pop stuff! could be interesting
	if there's a value, go fetch it?
	that'd require a backfetch: search by ID!
		for each in selection (usually just one), go fetch 'em

edit link must go away if there is nothing in the box!
	why is edit link not hidden, when nothing selected?
	javascript tweekage, execution order issue


PUSH LIVE

make 'enter' in the field do the search
	tab works, but the arrows, etc, would be nice too

note i have an onchange/onclick collision!
	customselect has processcustomselect, i have setstatus
	addeventlistener!



test with FF, and exploiter too
	before pushing live, make sure exploiter is ok with it


how to deal with duplicates?
	guess. then use it instead of inserting?
	this is a bigger problem in ANY record, if i insert a dupe or near dupe
		i should show a choose dialogue!
			a, b, c, or NEW entry

    

make the box bigger
	auto-grow, maybe? js?


maybe render subforms by shipping them (minus their form tags) via json?



Services_JSON seems to reccomend  $GLOBALS['HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA'];
	which  how jsolait sends stuff
		


4 hours javascript/php
json selectbox
	for goodies, a 'details' box next to the select
		showing more info on the selected item, javascript-refreshed
		possibly: on select, show full record in displaybox
			i.e. horiztable

don't let the flexac.css override my font. keep what's already there!


integrate with QF and CoopForm!
	start out with a pregenerateform
		then integrate it into a customjsonselect
    in coopform->addAndFillVars
    	if linkdisplay, break out the dispatching
    		do the link find
    			if N > 50 or so, use jsoneselectbox
    				load the javascript needed.
    		otherwise use old customselect
