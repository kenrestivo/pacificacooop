json select box notes


??JS/PHP
fix combobox to make it OOP, add keydown events
	don't use the global, make it a proper constructor
	construct one for each combo, named after the selectbox
		in tohtml, not getjs. why? because it'll be one for each
		make sure getjs is getting called first, so its settings get set.
	onchange methods should just call nameofglobal.fetchData() or something
	the constructor is where keydown/up events get added!


??JS/PHP
don't let them hit return to initiate a search?
	on key? look at flexac
	when hitting return before running a search
Error: [Exception... "Component returned failure code: 0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE) [nsIXMLHttpRequest.status]"  nsresult: "0x80040111 (NS_ERROR_NOT_AVAILABLE)"  location: "JS frame :: http://www/coop-dev/lib/flexac/kenflex.js :: anonymous :: line 61"  data: no]

	STUCK: got to redesign combobox, make it OOP, in BELOW THE LINE!



edit link must go away if there is nothing in the box!
	why is edit link not hidden, when nothing selected?
	javascript tweekage, execution order issue

??? PHP/JS
make edit javascript check (using json) the perms for this particular record
	i.e. if you have edit privs on some records, only show edit on those you do
	so, for family, if it's your family, edit it! otherwise hide away


make 'enter' in the field do the search
	tab works, but the arrows, etc, would be nice too

note i have an onchange/onclick collision!
	customselect has processcustomselect, i have setstatus
	addeventlistener!



test with FF, and exploiter too
	before pushing live, make sure exploiter is ok with it


how to deal with duplicates?
	guess. then use it instead of inserting?
	this is a bigger problem in ANY record, if i insert a dupe or near dupe
		i should show a choose dialogue!
			a, b, c, or NEW entry

    

make the box bigger
	auto-grow, maybe? js?


maybe render subforms by shipping them (minus their form tags) via json?



Services_JSON seems to reccomend  $GLOBALS['HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA'];
	which  how jsolait sends stuff
		


4 hours javascript/php
json selectbox
	for goodies, a 'details' box next to the select
		showing more info on the selected item, javascript-refreshed
		possibly: on select, show full record in displaybox
			i.e. horiztable

don't let the flexac.css override my font. keep what's already there!


integrate with QF and CoopForm!
	start out with a pregenerateform
		then integrate it into a customjsonselect
    in coopform->addAndFillVars
    	if linkdisplay, break out the dispatching
    		do the link find
    			if N > 50 or so, use jsoneselectbox
    				load the javascript needed.
    		otherwise use old customselect
