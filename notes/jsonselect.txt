??? javascript/php/python?
json selectbox
	use linkdisplayfields as search entry boxes (with _manglednames)
	js to search based on what the user types in (find button)
	populate scrolling selectbox (x lines) with results
		similar to existing customselect,
			the add/remove select with js tricks
	for goodies, a 'details' box next to the select
		showing more info on the selected item, javascript-refreshed
