json select box notes

things
20 minutes PHP
	select box 
	fields (with manglednames) for each linkdisplay in select object
	search button


understand selectbox updating
	i.e. my advmultiselect

decompose and understand the autocomplete box i just found
	where is it? IT'S JPSPAN!
	that might get me where i need to go, anyway.

FUCK getting this into customselect or jsonselect

actions
1 hour PHP
	search: run json query, fill box with results
	possibly: on select, show full record in displaybox
		i.e. horiztable


	

what exactly will i call?
	instantiate the sub object
	populate it



how to call remote methods?
	like in xmlrpc is there some way to query available methods?
		and function calls


in coopform->addAndFillVars
	if linkdisplay, break out the dispatching
		do the link find
			if N > 50 or so, use jsoneselectbox
		otherwise use old customselect


??? javascript/php/python?
json selectbox
	use linkdisplayfields as search entry boxes (with _manglednames)
	js to search based on what the user types in (find button)
	populate scrolling selectbox (x lines) with results
		similar to existing customselect,
			the add/remove select with js tricks
	for goodies, a 'details' box next to the select
		showing more info on the selected item, javascript-refreshed



how to deal with duplicates?
	guess. then use it instead of inserting


nice to have
	autocomplete with javascript



 * Example of Using HTML_AJAX in proxyless operation
 *
 * This is the simplest way to use HTML_AJAX if your just using grab and replace functions you don't even need a server
 * You need every javascript file except JSON which is optional and is only needed if your using that encoding
 *
 * The proxyless api is provided by Main.js
 *
 * There are 3 main methods and 2 properties to the proxyless api, they all exist as static methods on HTML_AJAX
 *	HTML_AJAX.grab(url)

 *	HTML_AJAX.replace(id,url) 
	or HTML_AJAX.replace(id,class,method,arg1,arg2,etc)

 *	HTML_AJAX.call(class,method,callback,arg1,arg2,etc)

 *
 *	HTML_AJAX.defaultServerUrl = 'serverurl';

 *	HTML_AJAX.defaultEncoding = 'Null';



??? JAVASXCRIPT
make ajax deal with nocookies
	pass SID through 
	the js will need to contend with this


maybe render subforms by shipping them (minus their form tags) via json?

other json things
	jpspan IS NOT JSON! it uses php for serialising. ugh.


json notes
	aha! json is just a way of seralising things. 
		it does *not* specify how to send
	Services_JSON seems to reccomend  $GLOBALS['HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA'];
		which is probably how jsolait sends stuff
