json select box notes


things
	select box
	fields (with manglednames) for each linkdisplay in select object
	search button

actions
	search: run json query, fill box with results
	possibly: on select, show full record in displaybox
		i.e. horiztable




will need to deal with auth/session
	how does the ajaxserver auth? will it get the same cookie? COOKIE!
		or do i need to pass a coop=SID to it?
	same thing with SESSION. i want to use the same session id
		hell, i *have* to
	try this autoserver
	

what exactly will i call?
	instantiate the sub object
	populate it


understand selectbox updating
	i.e. my advmultiselect





??? javascript/php/python?
json selectbox
	use linkdisplayfields as search entry boxes (with _manglednames)
	js to search based on what the user types in (find button)
	populate scrolling selectbox (x lines) with results
		similar to existing customselect,
			the add/remove select with js tricks
	for goodies, a 'details' box next to the select
		showing more info on the selected item, javascript-refreshed
