json select box notes

2 hours javascript/php/python?
json selectbox
	use linkdisplayfields as search entry boxes (with _manglednames)
	js to search based on what the user types in (find button)
	populate scrolling selectbox (x lines) with results
	similar to existing customselect, or the add/remove select with js tricks
	for goodies, a 'details' box next to the select
		showing more info on the selected item, javascript-refreshed
	this is basically a search screen built into a custom element
		consider starting off with all this shit in a separate window instead
			and populating on back, using my back/forward navigation
	have a look at the PEAR AJAX package!!
