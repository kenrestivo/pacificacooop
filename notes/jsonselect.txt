json stuff



???PHP/JS/SQL
de-dupe interface
	find all records, for each, look for matches, various types
		count them first, don't GET them
	let the user then go fish them out, and have a look
		list of possible duplicates. link to do something
	pick a master (radiobutton?)
		and checkbox for all which are duplicates
		then DE-DUPE!
	de-dupe back-end will go get all the references to non-match
		and merge them in
	need levenshtien

	
at insert time too?
	guess. then use it instead of inserting?
	this is a bigger problem in ANY record, if i insert a dupe or near dupe
		i should show a choose dialogue!
			a, b, c, or NEW entry


??JS 
show a label or field:value summary somewhere, somehow
	for goodies, a 'details' box next to the select
		showing more info on the selected item, javascript-refreshed
		possibly: on select, show full record in displaybox
			i.e. horiztable
		easiest is searchselect, with div


make the box bigger
	auto-grow, maybe? js?


maybe render subforms by shipping them (minus their form tags) via json?


		


don't let the flexac.css override my font. keep what's already there!
