json select box notes

yank the html escaping. unescape()?

test with FF, and exploiter too!
	before pushing live, make sure exploiter is ok with it


how to deal with duplicates?
	guess. then use it instead of inserting?


integrate flexac
	check for css fuckup: the box extends longer than the form!
	make it use a large selectbox, not a CSS popup
	  understand selectbox updating
  		i.e. my advmultiselect
	this is problematic! people will think they are ENTERING  


integrate with QF and CoopForm!
	start out with a pregenerateform
		then integrate it into a customjsonselect
    in coopform->addAndFillVars
    	if linkdisplay, break out the dispatching
    		do the link find
    			if N > 50 or so, use jsoneselectbox
    				load the javascript needed.
    		otherwise use old customselect


PUSH LIVE

    
actions
	pass auth through for no-cookies
		a parameter to config, no doubt
		if SID through set, i.e. no cookies
	

make the box bigger
	auto-grow, maybe? js?


maybe render subforms by shipping them (minus their form tags) via json?



Services_JSON seems to reccomend  $GLOBALS['HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA'];
	which  how jsolait sends stuff
		


4 hours javascript/php
json selectbox
	for goodies, a 'details' box next to the select
		showing more info on the selected item, javascript-refreshed
		possibly: on select, show full record in displaybox
			i.e. horiztable
