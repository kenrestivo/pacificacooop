json select box notes


things
20 minutes PHP
	select box 
	fields (with manglednames) for each linkdisplay in select object
	search button


actions
1 hour PHP
	search: run json query, fill box with results
	possibly: on select, show full record in displaybox
		i.e. horiztable



	

what exactly will i call?
	instantiate the sub object
	populate it


understand selectbox updating
	i.e. my advmultiselect





??? javascript/php/python?
json selectbox
	use linkdisplayfields as search entry boxes (with _manglednames)
	js to search based on what the user types in (find button)
	populate scrolling selectbox (x lines) with results
		similar to existing customselect,
			the add/remove select with js tricks
	for goodies, a 'details' box next to the select
		showing more info on the selected item, javascript-refreshed




nice to have
	autocomplete with javascript

 * Example of Using HTML_AJAX in proxyless operation
 *
 * This is the simplest way to use HTML_AJAX if your just using grab and replace functions you don't even need a server
 * You need every javascript file except JSON which is optional and is only needed if your using that encoding
 *
 * The proxyless api is provided by Main.js
 *
 * There are 3 main methods and 2 properties to the proxyless api, they all exist as static methods on HTML_AJAX
 *	HTML_AJAX.grab(url)

 *	HTML_AJAX.replace(id,url) 
	or HTML_AJAX.replace(id,class,method,arg1,arg2,etc)

 *	HTML_AJAX.call(class,method,callback,arg1,arg2,etc)

 *
 *	HTML_AJAX.defaultServerUrl = 'serverurl';

 *	HTML_AJAX.defaultEncoding = 'Null';



??? JAVASXCRIPT
make ajax deal with nocookies
	pass SID through 
	the js will need to contend with this


maybe render subforms by shipping them (minus their form tags) via json?
