json select box notes

ok, do mine now

4 hours javascript/php
json selectbox
	use linkdisplayfields as search entry boxes (with _manglednames)
	js to search based on what the user types in (find button)
	populate scrolling selectbox (x lines) with results
		similar to existing customselect,
			the add/remove select with js tricks
	for goodies, a 'details' box next to the select
		showing more info on the selected item, javascript-refreshed



integrate flexac
	move the fucking plugins dir.
		or, put it in the PEAR OBJECT! instead of loading plugins!
		things that make me crazy: subclass FlexacPlugin in plugins!
	check for css fuckup: the box extends longer than the form!
	make it use a large selectbox, not a CSS popup

test with FF, and exploiter too!
	before pushing live, make sure exploiter is ok with it


WHAT should i do with searching?

start out with a pregenerateform
	then integrate it into a customjsonselect


actions
	possibly: on select, show full record in displaybox
		i.e. horiztable

	

what exactly will i call?
	instantiate the sub object
	populate it


	pass auth through for no-cookies
		a parameter to config, no doubt


in coopform->addAndFillVars
	if linkdisplay, break out the dispatching
		do the link find
			if N > 50 or so, use jsoneselectbox
				load the javascript needed.
		otherwise use old customselect




how to deal with duplicates?
	guess. then use it instead of inserting


nice to have
	autocomplete with javascript



 * Example of Using HTML_AJAX in proxyless operation
 *
 * This is the simplest way to use HTML_AJAX if your just using grab and replace functions you don't even need a server
 * You need every javascript file except JSON which is optional and is only needed if your using that encoding
 *
 * The proxyless api is provided by Main.js
 *
 * There are 3 main methods and 2 properties to the proxyless api, they all exist as static methods on HTML_AJAX
 *	HTML_AJAX.grab(url)

 *	HTML_AJAX.replace(id,url) 
	or HTML_AJAX.replace(id,class,method,arg1,arg2,etc)

 *	HTML_AJAX.call(class,method,callback,arg1,arg2,etc)

 *
 *	HTML_AJAX.defaultServerUrl = 'serverurl';

 *	HTML_AJAX.defaultEncoding = 'Null';



??? JAVASXCRIPT
make ajax deal with nocookies
	pass SID through 
	the js will need to contend with this


maybe render subforms by shipping them (minus their form tags) via json?

other json things
	jpspan IS NOT JSON! it uses php for serialising. ugh.


json notes
	aha! json is just a way of seralising things. 
		it does *not* specify how to send
	Services_JSON seems to reccomend  $GLOBALS['HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA'];
		which is probably how jsolait sends stuff

AHA! eval(returndata) is how you turn json back into a javascript data structure
	that's what makes it an object

understand selectbox updating
	i.e. my advmultiselect

	newer/better browser should be link to firefox!!
