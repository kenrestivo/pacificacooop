json select box notes

ok, shall i make the calling form have the field name of the linkfield?
	do i know that at page-generation time (i.e. in qf customselect? i should!)


re-do, simpler
	and a SEARCH fucking button-- none of this fancy autocomplete
		on search, go get the data, and stuff it in the select. duh.
	what do do at edit time?


integrate with QF and CoopForm!
	start out with a pregenerateform
		then integrate it into a customjsonselect
    in coopform->addAndFillVars
    	if linkdisplay, break out the dispatching
    		do the link find
    			if N > 50 or so, use jsoneselectbox
    				load the javascript needed.
    		otherwise use old customselect


PUSH LIVE

do over from scratch
	maybe using only the
	a selectbox

the flexacChoose shouldn't fuck with my bg color. keep system colour!

test with FF, and exploiter too
	before pushing live, make sure exploiter is ok with it


how to deal with duplicates?
	guess. then use it instead of inserting?
	this is a bigger problem in ANY record, if i insert a dupe or near dupe
		i should show a choose dialogue!
			a, b, c, or NEW entry





    
actions
	pass auth through for no-cookies
		a parameter to config, no doubt
		if SID through set, i.e. no cookies
	

make the box bigger
	auto-grow, maybe? js?


maybe render subforms by shipping them (minus their form tags) via json?



Services_JSON seems to reccomend  $GLOBALS['HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA'];
	which  how jsolait sends stuff
		


4 hours javascript/php
json selectbox
	for goodies, a 'details' box next to the select
		showing more info on the selected item, javascript-refreshed
		possibly: on select, show full record in displaybox
			i.e. horiztable

don't let the flexac.css override my font. keep what's already there!
