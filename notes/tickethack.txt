OK here's how I can handle tickets quickly, on a deadline:

1) I hack up a quick screen for Erin to enter tickets and contacts without having to enter addresses. I can probably graft a "source" tracking on there too.

2) I also provide an Excel export which prints out all the PAID tickets: those from Invitations and from Erin's call-in sales. These will have a ticket number which can be used for tracking.

3) You handle solicitation freebie tickets manually in Excel, by entering off of Danielle's Xerox copies of the Solicitation stuff.

4) You also handle VIP's separately, via Barb's spreadsheet. 

5) The "greeters" printout becomes a cut-and-paste of the above 3 sets of data.

6) Paddle numbers are assigned by the greeters. Someone keeps a list of which paddle numbers go with which ticket numbers, IF you want to track purchases back.

7) Thank you's are handled manually based on the hard-copy RSVP cards. With my personal apologies to whomever has to sit there and do it, but, we can only tackle so much in one year.

8) I'll attempt to untangle all this later, probably after the event.

Standard disclaimer: the right way is to rearchitect the handling of 'contacts' so that families, solicitation companies, leads, vip's, alumni, are all in a unified 'contacts' table with many links to their respective different functions, and to 'events' which can happen to the contacts. 

Thank you for being kind enough to let me defer that work until after I'm recharged and ready. Gotta have something to look forward to next year!
