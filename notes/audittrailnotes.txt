audit trail niceties

audit trail niceties
	or only those that are subscribed to?
	table of subscriptions: realm, subscription
		a jointable, with an add/remove
		constrain: only those who have view perms on the realm
	for each realm: subscribe to:
		news
		alerts
		events
		changes
			maybe make changes the only one for now that has realm-specific

	make it groupy: members should have alerts defaulted to ON
		if nothing in the db for that user, use the group settings instead
	only those realms in the subscriptions tables, should i auditsave
	what happens when perms checking depends on content of fiel?
		my formatChanges method will fuck up big timex
	it might be a good idea to store the FORMATTED (checklinkfield) version!
		so that if the linked data changes, the change makes sense
			i.e. if i change kids.foo to kids.bar, and over time kids.foo changes
				the audittrail will be wrong! it'll be confusing.
	some text color maybe, for old to new (old in grey? new in red?)
