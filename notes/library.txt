QUESTIONS:
	is X legal?  yes

STEPS:
	remove illegal chars from the isbn number, i.e. only 0-9X
	go fetch (easy, URL above)
	parse xml
		the document.implementation.createDocument().load() way?
		or XMLHttpRequest.contentXML
	do the cuecat decoding
		cuedecode? seems simpler than kittycode
		have to guess whether what i've got is a cuecat or an isbn
		i have to fuck with the code, like i did in my perl thing
			the UPC is *not* the ISBN, goddammit
			it's in index.html, sorta. but it doesn't fucken work
		gah, and it fucking crashes the goddamned browser
			capture keystrokes, see what's breaking the damned thing
			joy, javascript hacking on a fucked-up machine
			well, just capture any non-ascii characters, and block them
				look at kenflex.js, i did this already
			i have to deal with EAN codes somehow7
		AHA! cc.html does this already?
