lookup title
	what about paging?! apparently there may be >1 page
		how long is a page? 
			looks like 10 to a page
		how do i get subsequent pages?
		i.e. searching for "ugly" or something really popular
		read docs
		bah! how to page around the fucking scrollbox!! geeh!
			i think i may have solved this with my ncurses library years ago?

	on click, show the details, and insert the isbn

	
scan the colours page, split them up, and assign them as appropriate
	move them to the primary category section
	
	
custom detail view fetching from amazon
	use curl and parse xml using php
	small or medium image
	used and new price summary
	short synopsis perhaps
	link to amazon.com

	
push the cuecat stuff live
	add/edit instructions about cuecat scanner as appropriate

EAN's as well as UPC's. read up on it; it's not easy
