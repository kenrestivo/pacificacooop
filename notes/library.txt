STEPS:
	make the special input subclass! with capturing chars or onchange
		capture return key like kenflex!
	must this be a subclass? or can i hack it as a predefelement?
		an input. a button. an onclick and onchange
	the qf dbdo stuff
		postgenerateform
			remove illegal chars from the isbn number, i.e. only 0-9X
		 	filter like floatonly, 0-9Xx
			insist on only 10 characters too!
	do the permissions shit
	
	do the cuecat decoding
		cuedecode? seems simpler than kittycode
		have to guess whether what i've got is a cuecat or an isbn
		i have to fuck with the code, like i did in my perl thing
			the UPC is *not* the ISBN, goddammit
			it's in index.html, sorta. but it doesn't fucken work
		gah, and it fucking crashes the goddamned browser
			capture keystrokes, see what's breaking the damned thing
			joy, javascript hacking on a fucked-up machine
			well, just capture any non-ascii characters, and block them
				look at kenflex.js, i did this already
			i have to deal with EAN codes somehow7
		AHA! cc.html does this already
		well, grab the data, parse isbn, and dump it in!
		any way to beep! tests/beeptest.html
