lookup title
	what about paging?! apparently there may be >1 page
		i.e. searching for "ugly" or something really popular
		how long is a page? 
			looks like 10 to a page
		how do i get subsequent pages?
			read docs
				ah, page=x duh.
		bah! how to page around the fucking scrollbox!! geeh!
			i think i may have solved this with my ncurses library years ago?
			calculate the position in the scrollbox, divided by number of lines?
				if last visible line  > 10 
					get page for top visible line
						scrollTop in ie and moz


	
scan the colours page, split them up, and assign them as appropriate
	move them to the primary category section
