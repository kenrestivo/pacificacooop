	advmultiselect the add/remove thing, when adding, remove the placeholder
		the bogus val in advmulti too
			make sure it doesn't break saving!!
		need it in ALL customselects, not just advmulti
			STUCK: it's sitting there in prepare, waiting for you

	weird open table: http://www/coop-dev/generic.php?action=details&table=users&push=users&users-user_id=23	 -- The content of element type "table" is incomplete, it must match "(caption?,(col*|colgroup*),thead?,tfoot?,(tbody+|tr+))"



	fix duplicate field names in betsy report
		stuttering schoolyearchooser in rasta, for betsy
			manually hack id!
			well, not that easy. it's in schoolyearchooser
		well, try making it a child of above
			that makes sense, but it still creates a second one
				where does it decide to CREATE them?
				just don't create it if it is already a child of same
		STUCK: this is evil. i'm goign to let this stay broken for now
