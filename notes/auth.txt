Well I have completed the refactor and cleanup that desperately needed to happen before anything else could move forward. *phew*

Carrie, I'm *really* sorry for the long delay. But, I'm almost ready to focus on 3x5 cards, and all this up-front work should make that go very quickly.

Matt, you may notice I moved a bunch of stuff into movetoshared.php, thus making it available for 3x5's. The only things left in financefuncs.inc are things *specific* to the money stuff, i.e. things that reference specific tables in the database. I also exposed a bit more out into money.php. It'll need to be there for auth.

I'm ready to do auth and have a plan. Couple policy questions:

I'm assuming auth will be by family, not by parent. Is there a situation where one parent might be authorised to do something but their spouse wouldn't be? Please let me know if that's going to be controversial.

Each family will be able to view/edit its own 3x5 entries. Certain privileged families (Carrie to provide a list?) will also be able to view and edit *all* entries. These users will also be able to enter 3x5's as other families (i.e. when doing data entry for non-computer-enabled families).

Now for passwords. 
	1) I could quickly generate random passwords for each family, and save them into a text file. But then someone would have to mailmerge them, print them out, and distribute them into people's communications folders. 
	or 2) I could add code to let families pick their own passwords, when they log in for the first time. 
Roughly the same amount of work: but it's a policy decision. (1) is arguably more secure, and (2) is arguably more user-friendly.
