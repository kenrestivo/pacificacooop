re-architect reports


PHPTAL nag reports
	which?
		parent ed nag (best choice, start from scratch)
			families, and all that they owe
		sf nag report
		enhancement nag
		solicitation summary
		springfest totals (carriereport)


??PHP/TAL/JSON
3 nifty new REPORTS in phptal! yay! with json email nag buttons!
	for springfest, enhancement, and parent ed
	move calcs into object
phptal? template engine for reports like the nag report? parent ed? enhancement?
	hmm, works on vaio, but not on bc. why?
	then load all those fucking libraries! on nfsn. not. fun.
		well, it might be easy!
		then again, maybe not!
		STUCK: the include paths: use LOGS, wtf is going on?
			include dbhost.inc BEFORE first.inc, or at the top of it
		know what? fuck it. put it in local_pear, if you can.
	now try it out, maybe for the reports
	settings
		cache dir? nocache? repository?
		xhtml/xml mode?
	setall! and setref (setall shoudl suffice, use refs if needed)
	for an expanded territory report maybe?



8 hours PHP
 	add in the nag report!!!
		re-do using PHPTAL!
	is there some way to use alerts instead of logic inside of nagreport??
		nice, to get a summary of all alerts for a family!
		yank that silly conditional at the top of the nagreport!
	show nags only by due dates passed!
		or, will my above alertstatus do it?
	get details working
		use generic with extradetails?
	add a 'send reminder' button, to send alerts


create a subclass of dispatcher, or a new dispatcher 

margolisreport: see parentedattentance.txt

report arch


birthdays report
	for this and next month, am/pm
	where to put it? students?


create a coopreport class, stick getreportperms into it
	make it a paralell of coopobject, probably not inheriting from it
	genericise some of the reports

	others?
		what do i do about reports!?
		table can have a view, but also some number of reports.
		HEY! how about one report for each realm!
		pick a generic report file, somewhere store all the reports!
			there must be *some* way of registering them.
			fuck it, stick a struct in a file and be done with it
			that's for *storing* the new ones.


??? PHP
parent ed attendance report that makes sense
	using adddefaultfamilyperms, as a model


???  PHP
	shirley's summary
	first, all enrolled families (like in sandyreport?)
	all enrollment totals (days)
		by family and kid
	make both reports group view only? 



baby report: how many babies per workday and epod day


??? PHP
	look at the sandyreport IT IS BORKEN
	the fucking linkconstraints... they're getting called when i don't want!
		how to override them?
	redo possibly with phptal
	
kudos system
	put the sandy report into that realm


test the enhancement summary!
	and thorough test on hours. that'll be the next bit of entry
	the show all thing is fubared?
	also, the chooseschoolyear can crash Enrollment.php
		blank start date for familyid 10 (2004-2005)
	maybe attach report to a table? so it's table/report?



report ideas
	add the reports to the object?
		i.e. some number of report_foo callbacks
		add a 'table' to reports? so reportname, table?
		how to dispatch? report state!
		how to stack pop/push?
			a report state (as opposed to view!)
			AND THE NAME OF THE REPORT!
	my current page-based thingus (for now)?
		perms as they are, basically	
		how to dispatch?
		how to stack pop/push?
			if there is a report block?
    stack needs to handle reports
    	things like chosenschoolyear and show/hide all need to be in last
    		add url to the 'last' glob?
    		or, in a subthing. searchsettings?
    cache chosen things in reports
      	search/sort
      		fall/spring, schoolyear, showall, in report
      	report varliable?
      		if blank, use 'view',otherwise a custom 



fix enhancement summary report to allow multiyear
	the date is broken in enhancement.php, 'bad date


list of families, and how many names have been entered so far
	um, by certain dates?
	only the delinquent ones?
	and, with email and phone and am/pm (heh) for the springfest cops to use

total dump of families and names
	incl. family name (and id?) and am/pm
	in excel format, for carol eggimann
