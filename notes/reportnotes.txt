report notes
$Id$

??PYTHON (yeah baybee!)
nifty label printing library reportlab!!
	set page properties properly
	do it as cgi
		content type, custom cooppage object (i need to log in, really)
			custom cooppage can have all the label stuff perhaps
		um, LOGGING!
		cgitb.enable(display=0, logdir='logs', format='text')
	dump in some real data
		use sqlobject directly?-- may be easier to start with this
		do a jsonrpc call? scary, not always reliable 


??PHP
stick reports into the stack, somehow
	save report_id!!? it's unique!
	maybe just a function in newdispatcher


create a subclass of dispatcher, or a new dispatcher 
	this will be a very MVC, rails-ish thing, i expect


coop_sendto
	move to dbhost
	need to be global ebcause it's referenced in session-init 
	but i have to move it into cooppage somewhere-- setting


margolisreport: see parentedattentance.txt

report arch

report generic
	maybe even for reports too!!!! so they are accessible
	what scares me is handlestack. if no table, what do i do?


birthdays report
	for this and next month, am/pm
	where to put it? students?


create a coopreport class, stick getreportperms into it
	make it a paralell of coopobject, probably not inheriting from it
	genericise some of the reports

	others?
		what do i do about reports!?
		table can have a view, but also some number of reports.
		HEY! how about one report for each realm!
		pick a generic report file, somewhere store all the reports!
			there must be *some* way of registering them.
			fuck it, stick a struct in a file and be done with it
			that's for *storing* the new ones.

finally make an iterator for coopview
		which uses view's toarray

??? PHP
parent ed attendance report that makes sense
	using adddefaultfamilyperms, as a model




baby report: how many babies per workday and epod day


??? PHP
	look at the sandyreport IT IS BORKEN
	the fucking linkconstraints... they're getting called when i don't want!
		how to override them?
	redo possibly with phptal
	
kudos system
	put the sandy report into that realm


test the enhancement summary!
	and thorough test on hours. that'll be the next bit of entry
	the show all thing is fubared?
	also, the chooseschoolyear can crash Enrollment.php
		blank start date for familyid 10 (2004-2005)
	maybe attach report to a table? so it's table/report?



report ideas
	add the reports to the object?
		i.e. some number of report_foo callbacks
		add a 'table' to reports? so reportname, table?
		how to dispatch? report state!
		how to stack pop/push?
			a report state (as opposed to view!)
			AND THE NAME OF THE REPORT!
	my current page-based thingus (for now)?
		perms as they are, basically	
		how to dispatch?
		how to stack pop/push?
			if there is a report block?
    stack needs to handle reports
    	things like chosenschoolyear and show/hide all need to be in last
    		add url to the 'last' glob?
    		or, in a subthing. searchsettings?
    cache chosen things in reports
      	search/sort
      		fall/spring, schoolyear, showall, in report
      	report varliable?
      		if blank, use 'view',otherwise a custom 



fix enhancement summary report to allow multiyear
	the date is broken in enhancement.php, 'bad date


list of families, and how many names have been entered so far
	um, by certain dates?
	only the delinquent ones?
	and, with email and phone and am/pm (heh) for the springfest cops to use

total dump of families and names
	incl. family name (and id?) and am/pm
	in excel format, for carol eggimann



	flow stuff beyond the page: i.e. data lines > fit on page
		IT FLOWS IT AUTOMATICALLY!!! YAY!!
