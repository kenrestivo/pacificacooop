40 hours PHP
re-architect reports

create a subclass of dispatcher, or a new dispatcher 


8 hours PHP
 	add in the nag report!!!
		re-do using html table
	is there some way to use alerts instead of logic inside of nagreport??
		nice, to get a summary of all alerts for a family!
		yank that silly conditional at the top of the nagreport!
	show nags only by due dates passed!
		or, will my above alertstatus do it?
	get details working
		use generic with extradetails?
	add a 'send reminder' button, to send alerts


margolisreport

report arch

create a coopreport class, stick getreportperms into it
	make it a paralell of coopobject, probably not inheriting from it
	genericise some of the reports

	others?
		what do i do about reports!?
		table can have a view, but also some number of reports.
		HEY! how about one report for each realm!
		pick a generic report file, somewhere store all the reports!
			there must be *some* way of registering them.
			fuck it, stick a struct in a file and be done with it
			that's for *storing* the new ones.


??? PHP
parent ed attendance report that makes sense
	using adddefaultfamilyperms, as a model



???  PHP
	shirley's summary
	first, all enrolled families (like in sandyreport?)
	all enrollment totals (days)
		by family and kid
	make both reports group view only? 



birthdays report
	for this and next month, am/pm
	where to put it? students?

baby report: how many babies per workday and epod day


??? PHP
	look at the sandyreport IT IS BORKEN
	the fucking linkconstraints... they're getting called when i don't want!
		how to override them?

kudos system
	put the sandy report into that realm


test the enhancement summary!
	and thorough test on hours. that'll be the next bit of entry
	the show all thing is fubared?
	also, the chooseschoolyear can crash Enrollment.php
		blank start date for familyid 10 (2004-2005)
	maybe attach report to a table? so it's table/report?



report ideas
	add the reports to the object?
		i.e. some number of report_foo callbacks
		add a 'table' to reports? so reportname, table?
		how to dispatch? report state!
		how to stack pop/push?
			a report state (as opposed to view!)
			AND THE NAME OF THE REPORT!
	my current page-based thingus (for now)?
		perms as they are, basically	
		how to dispatch?
		how to stack pop/push?
			if there is a report block?
    stack needs to handle reports
    	things like chosenschoolyear and show/hide all need to be in last
    		add url to the 'last' glob?
    		or, in a subthing. searchsettings?
    cache chosen things in reports
      	search/sort
      		fall/spring, schoolyear, showall, in report
      	report varliable?
      		if blank, use 'view',otherwise a custom 



fix enhancement summary report to allow multiyear
	the date is broken in enhancement.php, 'bad date


list of families, and how many names have been entered so far
	um, by certain dates?
	only the delinquent ones?
	and, with email and phone and am/pm (heh) for the springfest cops to use

total dump of families and names
	incl. family name (and id?) and am/pm
	in excel format, for carol eggimann
