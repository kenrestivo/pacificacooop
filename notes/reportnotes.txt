report notes
$Id$



test the enhancement summary!
	and thorough test on hours. that'll be the next bit of entry
	the show all thing is fubared?
	also, the chooseschoolyear can crash Enrollment.php
		blank start date for familyid 10 (2004-2005)
	maybe attach report to a table? so it's table/report?



report ideas
	add the reports to the object?
		i.e. some number of report_foo callbacks
		add a 'table' to reports? so reportname, table?
		how to dispatch? report state!
		how to stack pop/push?
			a report state (as opposed to view!)
			AND THE NAME OF THE REPORT!
	my current page-based thingus (for now)?
		perms as they are, basically	
		how to dispatch?
		how to stack pop/push?
			if there is a report block?
    stack needs to handle reports
    	things like chosenschoolyear and show/hide all need to be in last
    		add url to the 'last' glob?
    		or, in a subthing. searchsettings?
    cache chosen things in reports
      	search/sort
      		fall/spring, schoolyear, showall, in report
      	report varliable?
      		if blank, use 'view',otherwise a custom 


list of families, and how many names have been entered so far
	um, by certain dates?
	only the delinquent ones?
	and, with email and phone and am/pm (heh) for the springfest cops to use

total dump of families and names
	incl. family name (and id?) and am/pm
	in excel format, for carol eggimann
