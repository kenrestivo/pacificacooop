outputting to pdf..
	figure out bold for the package title: how to style text in a multicell?
		and italic for the bid sheet number
		and bold for biddernumber/amount headings
	somehow clamp the honeycomb, might be able to skid along as we are

						
unicode for fpdf! i might need this
	http://www.acko.net/node/56


			
a new paradigm: the BACKWARDS link... right joins
	i.e. everything in linktable, REGARDLESS of whether anything present here
	slots, basically
		all families/parents for a meeting (the button/bubble interface)
			even if nobody attended
		job assignments (show all job descriptions, including blanks)

		

???PHP/CSS
use CSS block for tabletitle instead of that enclosing table



??PHP
stick reports into the stack, somehow
	DOCUMENT the stack
	so i can navigate through them. AND so i can save stuff for them
	call newdispatcher in reports
	better yet, make the view function a subclass
		or, a generic_report.php
			which dispatches on reportid from list of reports
	for
		enhancement
		carrie
		nag
		solicitsumm
		attendance (new)
	

now, it might not need to be this complicated!
	why not stick the report shit into the last for that table?
		there almost always is a table, isn't there? a faketop?
	problem there is back. great, it builds the chooser, but now what?
		look at attendance

		

		the problem is putting div's inside of multicells, goddammit.
			ok, do an xslt transform to turn that embedded html into pdml then!
				some other time!

		


supply templates, subclass doctemplate
	nextpagetemplate to switch between them


create a subclass of dispatcher, or a new dispatcher 
	this will be a very MVC, rails-ish thing, i expect


	set pdf page/author/etc properties properly
		not that important, but not working either
	would be nice to have a header/footer with date/version on it!



margolisreport: see parentedattentance.txt

report arch

report generic
	maybe even for reports too!!!! so they are accessible
	what scares me is handlestack. if no table, what do i do?


birthdays report
	for this and next month, am/pm
	where to put it? students?


create a coopreport class, stick getreportperms into it
	make it a paralell of coopobject, probably not inheriting from it
	genericise some of the reports

	others?
		what do i do about reports!?
		table can have a view, but also some number of reports.
		HEY! how about one report for each realm!
		pick a generic report file, somewhere store all the reports!
			there must be *some* way of registering them.
			fuck it, stick a struct in a file and be done with it
			that's for *storing* the new ones.

finally make an iterator for coopview
		which uses view's toarray

??? PHP
parent ed attendance report that makes sense
	using adddefaultfamilyperms, as a model


??SQL/PHP
baby summary?: how many babies per workday and epod day


??? PHP
	look at the sandyreport IT IS BORKEN
	the fucking linkconstraints... they're getting called when i don't want!
		how to override them?
	redo possibly with phptal
	
kudos system
	put the sandy report into that realm


test the enhancement summary!
	and thorough test on hours. that'll be the next bit of entry
	the show all thing is fubared?
	also, the chooseschoolyear can crash Enrollment.php
		blank start date for familyid 10 (2004-2005)
	maybe attach report to a table? so it's table/report?



report ideas
	add the reports to the object?
		i.e. some number of report_foo callbacks
		add a 'table' to reports? so reportname, table?
		how to dispatch? report state!
		how to stack pop/push?
			a report state (as opposed to view!)
			AND THE NAME OF THE REPORT!
	my current page-based thingus (for now)?
		perms as they are, basically	
		how to dispatch?
		how to stack pop/push?
			if there is a report block?
    stack needs to handle reports
    	things like chosenschoolyear and show/hide all need to be in last
    		add url to the 'last' glob?
    		or, in a subthing. searchsettings?
    cache chosen things in reports
      	search/sort
      		fall/spring, schoolyear, showall, in report
      	report varliable?
      		if blank, use 'view',otherwise a custom 



fix enhancement summary report to allow multiyear
	the date is broken in enhancement.php, 'bad date


list of families, and how many names have been entered so far
	um, by certain dates?
	only the delinquent ones?
	and, with email and phone and am/pm (heh) for the springfest cops to use

total dump of families and names
	incl. family name (and id?) and am/pm
	in excel format, for carol eggimann



	flow stuff beyond the page: i.e. data lines > fit on page
		IT FLOWS IT AUTOMATICALLY!!! YAY!!

export/print
	the standard view stuff, minus pager
	grab from last
		in fact, grab EVERYTHING from last. s/b easy
	default: export whatever columns are in the result set
		unless there is a callback or columnlist
		using toarray to format them
	print-as-labels callback, if available?
	vagaries: special crap like honouring do not contact?
		don't deal with that now,  but will have to
	and an excel export, which i think i've done
		in perl. try python now!
			fuck, this really wouldn't be too hard in PHP anyway
		ah, the labelprinted stuff! important!
    	i.e. show a report, then some way to tag them as labelprinted
    		pick/choose date label printed too, or none
    		it's a searchable report, basically!
    	and, the "export to excel" just re-does that query as an excel export!
    		this is where mvc is cool. controller is same, view is different
    			excel view, web view
