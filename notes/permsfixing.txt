 notes on teh permissions redesign



check perms when 0's are in there.
	perm-modification-harness
	nice: the *only* functions which query the perms db are
		coopobj::getperms
		coopmenu::getreportperms
	save results from BEFORE query somewhere (python pickle?)
	do the modifications to change to the new db
		perhaps store them in the same script, or an sql script
	then run the *new* perms query, and compare/contrast


normalise the perms!
	this userlevel/grouplevel/menulevel is horseshit
	make a RIGHTS table: 
		rightid, type (enum, user/group/menu/year), level!
	then the table/report/user perms link to these rights
	easy normalisation, i think.	
	build a unit test of the existing permissions results
		matrix: user/group/realm/table/field/userlevel/grouplevel/menulevel/yearlevel
		check that before and after results are EXACTLY the same!
the levels idea is utterly wrong
	there should be individual rights, which are *not* level-specific
	things like, show all schoolyears. that doesn't map to the existing system.
	have to whack old pages before migrating to this kind of system
		it's in 60-some-odd pages
	menulevel becomes a menu "right"
	i like my moveboxes, but  checkboxes might be nicer
		grab from fb? they have their checkbox shit together.
	what sucks about this is that everything in my code needs to be re-done!
	my massive query then becomes several, which return lists of rights
		get all rights for this table/column/user combo
