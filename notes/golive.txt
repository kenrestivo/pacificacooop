I haven't heard back with any bug reports on what's been up there since yesterday. I'm going to consider this complete and ready to go live... although I would REALLY like for it to have had more testing. Unfortunately, I was right up to the wire on this one. My apologies.

Note the temporary URL: http://www.pacificacoop.org/sf-dev/
	this is just sf-dev/ with NO "php" extensions. Try it.

Present and working (as far as I can tell):
	- Auth, login, password entry, and user/group privilege checking
	- Auction donation items
	- Cash fees and donations
	- 10names -- now using the completely re-written set of library calls
	- The beginnings of some roster information
	- Show the user what their privileges are as they navigate around
	- A little menu for navigating around this stuff

Stuff that'll have to wait 'till later this week:
	- Editing/deleting 10names
	- Solicitation entry stuff
	- Tweaks that users won't see but that will bother me until they're done

Stuff that'll have to get added soon afterwards:
	- Privilege editing screen so you and a few others can "delegate"
	- Insurance display (field trip coming up in 2 weeks!)

Overall, I'm really happy with this so far. It's getting reasonably close to what I expected to deliver.

Right now, all users have the minimum set of permissions needed to get things done.  Carrie, please let me know *which* users will need privileges for things like:
	- entering, viewing and/or editing checks
	- entering, viewing and/or editing other people's 10names entries
	- entering, viewing and/or editing other people's auction donation items

The nag.php report is totally outside this auth system (for now ;-) so if that's the only thing anyone needs to see, that's fine. Matt, I'll assume you'll do the honors of adding the auction items (left join faglue) to nag.php.

Cutting this over from the fake to the live database may take an hour or two, since I have to copy over the users/privs and be super-careful that everything matches up properly. If there are any problems, please let me know before tomorrow night. 

Ana will be going to the Parent Ed meeting, and, after Gina goes to sleep is when I am planning to put aside time to push it live.
