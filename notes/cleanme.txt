random things that really really need to get cleaned up

???PHP
do NOT dick with request in coopview!
	instead, find some way to extend my merging code in dispatcher
	so that it will include things like search/sort variables from view!
	look at syform. quickform has its own ways of dealing with saved vars
		find out whatever i do in coopform, and do it in syform too


??PHP
blow off pagetop completely
	and use LOGIN like my template-friendly version
	fix the CSS issues in exploiter too
	separate out APP logic from PRESENTATION
		the APP logic must occur in a certain order
			the presentation logic is in a TOTALLY different order
			shouldn't have anything to do with each other!
