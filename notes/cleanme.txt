random things that really really need to get cleaned up


	save the diff's, NOT the entire whooha
		if that's possible in text/diff mode
			maybe only the textfields
		but how to format that for email??


smaller damned font
	how does this look in exploiter? font-size: 101%

go through the joinpaths in standard linkconstraints!
	i bet i can blow off tons of wacko custom linkconstraints this way!


shitcan flexac

    remove crufty files
    	cvs remove the whole list of crufty files: foundold-clean.txt
    		first awk/split it out
    		then run another qa, just to be sure!
    	save tickets and thankyou's and paddles, dammit.
    		deal with that clusterfuck over the holiday



???PHP
do NOT dick with request in coopview!
	instead, find some way to extend my merging code in dispatcher
	so that it will include things like search/sort variables from view!
	look at syform. quickform has its own ways of dealing with saved vars
		find out whatever i do in coopform, and do it in syform too


??PHP
blow off pagetop completely
	and use LOGIN like my template-friendly version
	fix the CSS issues in exploiter too
	separate out APP logic from PRESENTATION
		the APP logic must occur in a certain order
			the presentation logic is in a TOTALLY different order
			shouldn't have anything to do with each other!
	construct the <HEAD> *last*, after the whole body is done
		buffer the entire page, no matter how fucking enormous
			this also gets me a <title> that makes sense too
			wouldn't take much to TAL the whole app, actually


???PHP
clean up my inclusion order in proparation h for phptal
	remember the set names!!!

	what about deletes? no audit trail on deletes... interesting


	generic dispatcher
		then use that for my fix-whateve
