Folks, I have run out of time and I'm told you are building packages tomorrow. I really wanted to finish a web-based interface so you can group auctions together online to make packages, but it looks like I won't make it in time. Sorry about that.

Instead, it looks like you're going to be using Excel and/or Word. I've been told that it may work out better that way anyway, due to the dynamic nature of how packages are made.

I created a link from which you can export into M$ Excel or Word, the list of RECEIVED packages. I'm assuming you will only be building packages out of items that have been received.

It's available from the "Springfest Packaging Inventory" report in the main menu. There's a link that says: "Click here to export RECEIVED items into a spreadsheet". If you want to cut to the chase, you can also get it from http://www.pacificacoop.org/sf/exportpkg.pl

I'm a bit nervous how this will work if you keep receiving packages up till the last minute. I hope that doesn't happen, and everything works out well. Please accept my apologies-- I hate it when I don't deliver what I said I'd deliver-- but hopefully "there's always next year".

Let me know if you run into any trouble and I'll certainly be glad to fix it immediately.
