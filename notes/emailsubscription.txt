email subscription notes

?? PHP
add hooks in new/update
	just async trigger the update!
		the audittrailid

??? PHP
how to call async emailing
look around for a good example
	shell_exec('nohup something')
	or, ignore_user_abort


??? PHP
actually do the emailing!
	calculate the body of the email
		grab the audit details, 
			format them
		or if no details, the whole data record
			use fieldstorender and fieldlabels
	find all realms for that table
		for each realm,
			spam everyone who subscribed to it


format for email
	from: pacificacoop
	subject: NEWS/ALERT/NOTICE [subject/title]
	insert the regular content



??? PHP
the tricky bit is alerts. they have to be checked, somehow
	maybe those are manual
	or maybe i save status of who has been alerted?
