email subscription notes

format for email
	from: pacificacoop
	subject: NEWS/ALERT/NOTICE [subject/title]
	insert the regular content


need hooks for new 
	blog insertion or edit: 
	any rasta-related table edit or add


trigger an email
	or, let the user do it manually?


at insert time, SOME things will need to trigger email

notify() trigger email function
	look in subscription list
	spam everyone who subscribed

look around for a good example
	shell_exec('nohup something')
	or, ignore_user_abort

the tricky bit is alerts. they have to be checked, somehow
	maybe those are manual
	or maybe i save status of who has been alerted?
