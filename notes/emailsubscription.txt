email subscription notes

?? PHP
add hooks in new/update
	just async trigger the update!
		the audittrailid
	deal with the fucking path to this file


??? SQL/python?/PHP?
this'll get ugly. i'll need special hacky things to add default subscriptions
	i.e... for news, parent ed, enhancement, all the springfest realms, etc
	for now, a nasty python or php hack





will need to handle deletions too


??? SQL
hmm. what about teachers? there's no place for their email address. dammit.
	maybe i should put some data for teachers in there.
	putting email addresses into users is brain-dead. needs to be in rasta




format for email
	from: pacificacoop
	subject: NEWS/ALERT/NOTICE [subject/title]
	insert the regular content



??? PHP
the tricky bit is alerts. they have to be checked, somehow
	maybe those are manual
	or maybe i save status of who has been alerted?
