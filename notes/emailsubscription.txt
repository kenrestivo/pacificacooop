email subscription notes

??? PHP
actually do the emailing!
	then send it, to all in query
		if devsite, only send to ONE address: me


??? SQL/python?/PHP?
this'll get ugly. i'll need special hacky things to add default subscriptions
	i.e... for news, parent ed, enhancement, all the springfest realms, etc
	for now, a nasty python or php hack

will need to handle deletions too



hmm. what about teachers? there's no place for their email address. dammit.
	maybe i should put some data for teachers in there.
	putting email addresses into users is brain-dead. needs to be in rasta




?? PHP
add hooks in new/update
	just async trigger the update!
		the audittrailid

??? PHP
how to call async emailing
look around for a good example
	shell_exec('nohup something')
	or, ignore_user_abort



format for email
	from: pacificacoop
	subject: NEWS/ALERT/NOTICE [subject/title]
	insert the regular content



??? PHP
the tricky bit is alerts. they have to be checked, somehow
	maybe those are manual
	or maybe i save status of who has been alerted?
