email subscription notes
		

?? PHP
translate br's to nl's

will need to handle deletions too


??? SQL
hmm. what about teachers? there's no place for their email address. dammit.
	maybe i should put some data for teachers in there.
	putting email addresses into users is brain-dead. needs to be in rasta



??? PHP
the tricky bit is alerts. they have to be checked, somehow
	maybe those are manual
	or maybe i save status of who has been alerted?


??? SQL/PHP
this'll get ugly. i'll need special hacky things to add default subscriptions
	i.e... for news, parent ed, enhancement, all the springfest realms, etc
	for now, a nasty python or php hack
	EVERYONE currently enrolled
		alerts:
			enhancement, attendance, calendar
		new:
			news
			reminders
			calendar
		change:
			news
			calendar
	add these at new-family time too!
		where? a setdefaults class or function?
				post-insert in families?? ooh!
		should i store these things somewhere?
			for now, in a class. i can always back it with db later on
	i'll have to check to see if they have any entries FIRST
		then add new. i'd so much prefer to do this in python... dammit...

	group or chooser?
		fucking just do it. nevermind doing it right for now. 
		this'll eventually be a margolis-like thing, falling out of parented
			all enrolled families, rows of subscription realm, checkboxen

	THIS SUCKS. how can i change the defaults once i've set them?
		i can't. this idea is brain-dead. i should use groups instead.
			that means fucking with my query. that could, um, suck.
