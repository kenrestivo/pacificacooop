I am happy to report that the all-new-and-(hopefully)improved data-entry web site is live at:
	http://www.pacificacoop.org/sf/

It now handles:
	- Solicitation donations, solicitation contacts, and solicitation income
	- Raffle income and raffle locations
	- Some ability to click around between screens without using the main menu
	- Simpler, slightly more user-friendly log-in screen for new users.
	- Audit trail (not yet visible) for all transactions.
	- Fixes for lots of little bugs you may or may not have seen.

Feel free to start entering stuff. Sooner would be great if possible... I'm setting aside time this weekend to answer questions and fix any bugs.

There is still much yet to be done, but Ana will be on vacation this week, and I will be taking care of Gina all by myself. New features or major changes may have to wait a week, but if you run up against anything that looks obviously broken, please do not hesitate to call or email and I'll be glad to fix it ASAP.

Thank you so much for all your help with testing, and for your patience.
