I'm confused. The greeters are going to be sitting there with highlighters?

But you could conceivably have one line per TICKET (i.e. if you buy 4 tickets you get 4 lines), with a paddle number, or NO paddle number if they weren't supposed to get one. So that may solve that problem.

A separate but related problem is that then each line will be populated with the ticket PURCHASER's name/address/phone. There'll be no space to write down new addresses. Whereas, if only the top-level ticket-purchaser has address info, there will be lines for each attendee. If the data is heirarchal, I think you're going to end up with a heirarchal report eventually.

As for packages: alas, the prices in the packages are numeric fields. Important so that you can do math on them, like total them up. I probably should have caught "priceless" on last year's program, but, unfortunately, I missed that one. Sorry about that.

As a workaround, I'd suggest putting zero dollars in for packages with "priceless" value. I can have the Excel export change zero values to "Priceless" when it goes to the Program people.
