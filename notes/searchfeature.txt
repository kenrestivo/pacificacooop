a cool nifty SEARCH BOX in all generic views!!


??? PHP
proper generic search feature!!
	i.e. the beginning of what i have in audit trail!!
	this would FUCKING RULE
	maybe javascript hide the form, so it pops up only when needed!!
	add records to show to it
	put it in generic or coopview
		i think generic is the most logical place for it
	and an ALL button

build a quickform, much like the standard build
	subclass coopform? searchform?
	slight differences
		add all the fields the user has VIEW perms for (not edit/add)
	actions will be different: not insert/update


the generic view and/or constraints and/or simple table will need to change
	it already constrains based on id supplied. needs to do others too
	and "like" for non-numeric fields.... hmm, could get ugly
