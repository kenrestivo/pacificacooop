a cool nifty SEARCH BOX in all generic views!!

task:
	turn the schoolyearchooser into a proper search/sort interface
		look at audit trail and/or parent ed for inspiration
		wrap it in javascript hiding. click here to search/sort.
		LO: metacharacters and/or !=, > , <
	save/restore the state of the search.
	support LIMIT box
	LO: eventually support pager

special cases:
	table_name link to realms		

how?
	a search-interface form
		takes a list of fields to allow search on
		build a form, similar to COopForm (subclass?)
			handling schoolyear and familyid specially, as coopform already does
			by default, just as in coopform, default SY=current, family=mine
	instead of insert/update, build MORE CONSTRAINTS!
		use 'like' for any non-numeric fields
			i'll have to deal with table() to check that
		make sure it doesn't collide with linkconstraints
			override them? check them?
	save/restore the state
		i also have to deal with chosenschoolyear too
			it and getChosenSchoolYear will be obsolete
		HOW? WHERE?
	inserting the form into the coopview
		dump it into coopview->yeartitle ?
			change name to searchsortchooer?
		or, just store a reference to the BUILT FORM in coopview
			and tohtml() it at rendering time. probably smarter.

what about sorting?

??? PHP
proper generic search feature!!
	i.e. the beginning of what i have in audit trail!!
	this would FUCKING RULE
	maybe javascript hide the form, so it pops up only when needed!!
	add records to show to it
	put it in generic or coopview
		i think generic is the most logical place for it
	and an ALL button

build a quickform, much like the standard build
	subclass coopform? searchform?
	slight differences
		add all the fields the user has VIEW perms for (not edit/add)
	actions will be different: not insert/update


the generic view and/or constraints and/or simple table will need to change
	it already constrains based on id supplied. needs to do others too
	and "like" for non-numeric fields.... hmm, could get ugly


sort by too. make column headings clickable
	this is basically SDG, but SDG has... issues...
