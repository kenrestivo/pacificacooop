OK well I felt so guilty about not finishing the online Package-making stuff, that I chose to redeem myself by finishing it!

It's here at http://www.pacificacoop.org/sf (I pushed it live, to save time).

Your call if you want to use it or not. It may be easier than doing it in Excel, it may be harder, I dunno.

Basically, from the main menu, there is a new menu item called "Springfest Packages". Sue can go in to CREATE/EDIT/DELETE packages; everyone else in the Packaging Committee can VIEW them. I put in a sample one for testing, please feel free to delete or modify it.

Then, in the "Springfest Packaging Inventory" report, everyone in packaging can see what package each auction item is part of. Sue can ASSIGN it to a package by clicking "Edit" and then choosing the package number from the pop-up.

I will (probably tomorrow) have the "package number" field (and pop-up) show the description as well, in case you won't have the package numbers memorised. ;-)

It took literally 1 hour of work to do this, after weeks of trying to figure out how to do it!

Again, it's there, and it's yours to use if you so choose. If you want any changes or additions, please let me know. 

If you have already gotten pretty far along with Excel, then I can probably import it back in, if need be, just email it to me.

Cheers!
