parent ed attendance


???SQL/PHP
add make-up table for parent ed
	meeting makeup types
		$20 fee
			(link to family fees!)
		attend board meeting or open house
			(link to event!)
		cover for someone
			date/comments?
			(link to coverage type)
				maternity
				assessment/conference week
				teacher absence
	modeled on nag indulgences
		but this will need a js dispatch AND validation
			based on type of event. fun! here comes json!
	and add yet another layer of subqueries to my report
		go get sum of all indulgences this schoolyear by family
			and calculate it in to meetings
	pattern
		table A has a field i, which is the PK of table B. 
		table A also 
               needs to link to tables C, D, or E (not and!) 
					based on the value of field i
		 table B might have a PK and a *name* of a table for A to link to
	select A.id, IF(A.tref = 'B',B.val,IF(A.tref='C',C.val,NULL)) val 
			FROM A left join B using (id) left join C using (id);


meeting screen redux
	stuff the whole thing into the display_view
	NAG button, with reminder count
		there is a nag table, whoopee
		and a send reminder button
			similar to send_email, but use json this time
		count updates via js, when complete
	perhaps another screen to choose those
		show both parents for now
	show only the parent who is on the real form?
		maybe a button to choose another?



link for choosing only those who need nagging, vs those who do not
	look at alphapager for inspiration


then, that meeting screen
	meeting chooser at top
	list of families, sub by parents, and 3 checkboxes
	SAVE will do what?
		calculate differences, and save those
			POSTING what? json?
				validation!!!
					what rules am i using really
					dupe check, what else?
						can i modularise them?
					or use qf... though that could really suck
			how to report errors? 500? 400?
		for now, just use json-rpc. post an ARRAY! the updated stuff
			and let the server deal with it






for fun, try building it as a command-line API
	i like commandline apis
		like my eventumbot thing
	what about saving?
		could do that individually, at least for the API

	make it restful:
		rest/  => returns  documentation on the API!
		rest/[table]/   => everything in the table (perms? default constraint?)
		rest/[table]/search?foo=bar&baz=quux  =>  all matches
		rest/[table]/count   => total num records in db (perms? constraint?)
		rest/[table]/count?foo=bar&baz=quux  =>  count of matches
		rest/[table]/[id]       =>  single json record
		rest/[table]/[id]?format=[label|html|json|xml]    =>  as label
		rest/[table]/[id]/[subtable]/ => repeat as above!!
	GET to get, POST to something with an id, to update, or to a table to NEW
	use allyears to decide default schoolyear, just like in view


	so, in my parent ed example: rememmber, it's stateless!
			and some js for detail buttons
		GET rest/parent_ed_attendance/search?family_id=some
			HOW to deal with the links??
			

	

				


	response format?


per meeting form/report
	prototype it, just for fun, using phptal
	meeting chooser at top (the one in the displayview might work!)
	list of families with parents underneath
		that's a phptal thing
	finally the three dots-- checkboxes for now, keep it simple
	
	hey, maybe i don't need phptal at all?
		saving? how?


the neat margolis funky attendance form/report
	FAMILIES alphabetical
	use phptal
	first just show a report with all the families and what they owe	



margolis has an interesting idea
	for parent ed attendance, show ALL attendance for one meeting
		with checkboxes. check all, uncheck all
		javascript: hide the actual hours, use checkboxes instead
	at save time, save for the ENTIRE meeting
		at least everyone who was enrolled at that time (start/drop dates)
		you'd have to go through and look at which changed, save them only if
		and of course INSERT for any parents who didn't have attendance
	this'd be a wacky custom form, having little/nothing to do with coopform
		might be fun playign with it!
	i don't think pear is right for this. XUL?

????
	get that javascript listener shit for firefox going with emacs!
	to talk to my own custom thing


this WILL BE the view for parentedattendance IFF the user has group >= VIEW

10 minutes
	chooser for parent ed meeting (same popup that is in parentedattendance DBO)

1 hour
	custom html table
	for each enrolled family (standard families query with the linkconstraints!)
		show each parent, and their attendance for that meeting, if any



attendance will be 3 checkboxes
	optional: with a "check/uncheck all" button
	this is pure javascript (look at advcheckbox and my add/remove thing)	
	hidden field for hours


2 hours

	who's missing report: all enrolled parents, all meetings to date
	
	try thinking in terms of sets

	parent ed attendance  report, similar to enhancement nag SQL
		i think i'll be mangling it, using php not sql
		i have to first get all the meetings to date

	display_view subselect: grab all the meetings up to this date SQL
		then sum the hours for each family!.... maybe hilite any nulls
		and, only show those that having < 3 hours

 	alert needs to calculate how many meetings so far, based on date/sy SQL
		then compare attendance to that date
		gah, do it in sql.
		subselect
