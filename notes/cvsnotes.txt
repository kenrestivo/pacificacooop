	cd web
	cvd and commit as needed
	cd ../web-online
	make sync!!! important step! capture whatever matt may have done
	cvd and manually review and commit any changes to sf-dev site online
	cvs update -kk -j dev_online -j HEAD
	test it here?
	upload-dev the thing
	check it out on real site
	commit it, probbly
	then upload-dev AGAIN, so the $id's are in sync
