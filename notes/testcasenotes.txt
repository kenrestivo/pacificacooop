testcase tool
		FuncExistsString is gonna be key
			SHIT! it's fucking case sensitive. that BLOZE!
			but, it's also OR not AND.... so i could have HTML,html
			to and them, use separate call-- DOCS ARE WRONG
		FuncExistsTag for the /html!
		FuncExistsTableTag blows. it just shows that the table EXISTS!
			it does NOT go fishign around in there looking at values. grr.
		FuncExistsSelectTag for contents of a selectbox
			optionally !{content} isntead of value
		runner can use ${vars} for url, for example
			GOOD! i can use it on coop-dev too!
			but... this doesn't actually seem to WORK.. why?

nice:
	the record or "watch me" mode-- VERY helpful

complaints:
	this excel thing is brain dead. it doesn't let you DIFF in cvs!!
		it also requires some kind of gui editor, which i hate
	ack. it executes the files in no particular order!
		which means you have to RENAME them to get them in teh right order!!?
		RIDICULOUS! how can i do cvs with that? with ln -s? it's absurd.
	no way to set continuations/cleanups/exceptions!
		i.e. after i'm done, i want to DELETE all the entries i made!

things to fix:
	hmm. how to handle EDITING? which one to click on?
		it's not like httpunit: it doesn't understand CLICKS.
		i may have to write JAVA to get it to do that!??!
			look at its examples. ouch.
				OH SHIT that would suck. cvs import time...!
	gonna have to write some scripts to mangle this stuff
		parse out the flat text, into my preferred format!
		turn it into flat text, tab or whitespace nested
		make it MODULAR!
			so i can build test cases dynamically, turn it into a spreadsheet
			MODULE
				thing value
				thing value
				thing value
				function
					op arg
					op arg
					op arg
		let the script do the auto-numbering.
			and the include'ing

you know what? this thing is ONLY useful for its watch mode.
	write something to parse out its excel file into a file for a DIFFERENT tool
		i.e. httpunit, itp, etc.
