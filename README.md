Pacifica Co-Op Nursery School Back End (old version)
====================================================


This was developed between 2003 and 2006, originally to handle online listings for the SpringFest fundraiser, then it ballooned out into being an online system for managing the whole fundraiser, and then an online system for managing the school schedule and complete back-end office. Finally, it got appended to a Drupal installation in mid-2006.

The interesting stuff is in the "drupal/members" directory. There's a README there too.

Posting publicly 10 years later because why not.
