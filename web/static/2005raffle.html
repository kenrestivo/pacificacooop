<h2>&ldquo;Surf&rsquo;s
Up at Co-op Fundraiser&rdquo;
</h2>

<P> With the surf trade helping
the local economy, and a tight-knit local crew, it&rsquo;s no
surprise when surfers themselves contribute for the good of the
community.

<P>
</P>
<P>For the second year in
a row, local surfing entrepreneurs have donated a collectors-grade
surfboard to Pacifica Co-op Nursery School for its annual Springfest
fundraiser.</P>
<p> 
</P>
<p>The surfers&rsquo;
contribution came as no surprise to Springfest Co-chair Lauri
Vreeland. &ldquo;Well, the Pedro Point Surf Club, they have their
annual scholarship,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There are attorneys who
surf. There are a lot of artists in the water; it&rsquo;s such a
broad spectrum of life. They (surfers) do a lot for this community
and a lot of people don&rsquo;t know about that.&rdquo;</P>
<p>
</P>
<p>Local professional
surfer Matt Ambrose and his wife Leigh Ann, Co-op parents,
spearheaded the first surfboard raffle last year. Neptune Surfboards
co-owner Brent Hudson donated a ten-foot surfboard, which is called a
&ldquo;gun,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d designed to surf Maverick&rsquo;s, the
world-famous big-wave break in Half Moon Bay. 
</P>
<p>
</P>
<p>The board was glassed
by Randy Cone and decorated by local artist Kevin Ancell, who is
world-renowned for his work with various media ranging from movie set
design and sculpture to oil painting and building art surfboards.</P>
<p> 
</P>
<p>Ambrose was going to
shape the first board for the raffle, but it turned out that Hudson
had shaped a surfboard blank too thin for his own use.  
</P>
<p>
</P>
<p>In past years, the
Co-op raffle prize was a quilt crafted by a group of parents. &ldquo;But
last year Leigh Ann thought of having Matt and herself put together a
board for the raffle,&rdquo; said Co-op President Eileen
Manning-Villar. &ldquo;It was a very successful fundraiser for the
school.&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
</P>
<p>The surfboard raffle is
fast becoming a grand draw for the fundraiser. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
taken it up a notch from the quilt&mdash;I think that was a beautiful
thing too,&rdquo; Vreeland said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really accelerated
the event and included a lot more of the community.&rdquo;   
</P>

<p>This year, Matt Ambrose
has collaborated again with Ancell, purchasing a balsa wood longboard
from Santa Barbara shaper Reynolds Yater. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been
around forever. He used to shape for Velzy and he was a big part of
the shortboard revolution.&rdquo; Sticking to an ocean theme, Ancell
adorned the deck with a mermaid from shiny Mother-of-Pearl inlay,
with flowing hair made of gold leaf and India ink, glassing it with a
shiny gloss coat. 
</P>
<p>
</P>
<p>&ldquo;If I was selling
this board, it would go for at least two or three grand,&rdquo;
Ancell said. 
</P>
<p> 
</P>
<p>If the Mavericks Surf
Contest happens this year, Manning-Villar said, she hopes to
accompany Leigh Ann, and a few other Co-op parents to display the
board at the Pillar Point contest site. 
</P>
<p>
</P>
<p>The contest, which is
held if the waves reach at least 20-25 feet, draws thousands of
spectators who line the cliffs to watch the invitees challenge the
powerful surf. Ancell created the trophies for the contest, and
Matt, part of the first crew of locals to regularly surf the break
with Jeff Clark in the early nineties, is always a contender in the
contest. 
</P>
<p>
</P>
<p>The board will be
displayed at Salada Beach Caf&eacute; through the month of February.
After that it can be viewed at NorCal Surf Shop and it is scheduled
to make appearances at Linda Mar Safeway, Pacifica Farmer&rsquo;s
Market, Kerry&rsquo;s Coffee Shop, Chit Chat Caf&eacute;, Colombo&rsquo;s
Deli, Pacifica Mothers&rsquo; Club, Oceana High School and Terra Nova
High School. 
</P>
<p>
</P>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re
excited that the Ambrose Family is involved again this year,&rdquo;
Vreeland said. &ldquo;This is such a surfing community and it&rsquo;s
really a draw at the Springfest event.&rdquo; 
</P>
<p>
</P>
<p>Proceeds from
Springfest will help keep tuition costs down at the 44-year old
school. It will also go toward the ever necessary capital
improvements and routine maintenance.  
</P>
<p>  
</P>
<p>Springfest 2005 will be
held on Saturday, March 19, from 6:30 to 10:30 p.m. at the Pacifica
Community Center, 540 Crespi Drive. It will include silent and live
auctions, wine tasting, and hearty hors d&rsquo;oeuvres in addition
to the surfboard raffle. Tickets for the event are $25 and attendees
must be at least 21. For tickets, information or to purchase an ad in
