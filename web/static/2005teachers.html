<h2>
Pacifica Co-op Nursery School Directors are the Best and The Brightest
</h2>

<p>By Joanne Simonson, Parent</p>

<p>
I had worked in the public education system for over 10 years when my first
child was born in 1996.  As I talked to local parents and sought their
advice, there was one clear recommendation.  I must get on the waiting list
to attend the Pacifica Co-op Nursery School.  Some parents actually
recommended I place her name on the waiting list BEFORE she was born.
Well, this was not actually allowed, but I did put her name in before she
was 6 months of age, anticipating that time when she would be 2 ½ years of
age and potty trained.  I also arranged my work schedule to allow for a
half day off each week beginning in the year that she would be "eligible."
That was six years, two children, four (collective) summer sessions of Bug
School, and three Springfests ago.  As an educator, a parent, and a
community member, I can say it has all been worth the effort.   I have
learned about children in general and my children in particular, supported
by the hands-on experience of working side-by-side with the talented and
committed women who develop and orchestrate the daily program.

At the Pacifica Co-op Nursery School, all parents are recognized as
teachers, but the heart and soul of the program still rests with Teacher
Sandy Wallace and her assistant directors, Catherine Miller and Diana Taur-
McMillan.  Each brings a personal style and background to the demanding job
of not only developing and implementing a preschool curriculum, but also in
guiding parents as they work with the groups of children, working with a
different group of five to seven parents each day.   This year, perhaps
more than in previous years, these three women represent three very
different levels of development in the history of the Pacifica Co-op, while
sharing an interest in working with young children and their families.

Teacher Sandy Wallace is perhaps the best known of the teaching staff at the
nursery school.  She was recently recognized for her 25 years of service to
the Jefferson Union High School District, which oversees the nursery school
program.  Of those years, 23 were spent at the Pacifica Co-op.  This has
been done while raising her own family.  Teacher Sandy has shaped and
developed the entire program over the years, usually developing her own
materials to support the varied curriculum units.  This also includes a
monthly parent education component.   She meets bi-monthly with the two
assistant directors to finalize curriculum plans.  She is continually
developing and refining her parent education programs, bringing in current
research and ideas.   She also has the help and support of her husband,
Doug, who regularly attends the end of year campout, helps in planning and
pitches in whenever needed.  This has included a very hands-on role in the
Playground Build.  She has worked with countless families and extended
families, many of which come from surrounding cities in order to attend the
Pacifica Co-op.

Teacher Catherine Miller came into her teaching role at the nursery school
through the most natural way possible.  She was a parent there, with her
Liam, now in the 3rd grade at Cabrillo School.  She explains that her older
son, Jaime, now in the 7th grade, still remembers that he was the only one
of his friends who did NOT attend the Co-op.  She vowed that her second son
would not miss the vital Co-op experience.  Catherine also has more than 20
years of experience in early child hood education, from running her own in-
home childcare business to working in and acting as director in several
traditional preschools.  This is her 4th year as assistant director at the
Co-op.  While in previous years, the worked with both the morning and
afternoon programs, this year she is working exclusively with the morning
program.  In addition to her role as teacher to the entire group, she has
designed a Little Group Program for those children who are kindergarten
bound in September 2005.  She finds the preschool age group to be
particularly inspiring, and has a genuine love for all the children she
works with.

Newest to the teacher staff is Diana Taur-McMillan, who is assistant
director for the afternoon session.  Diana was born and raised in Estonia
and has been in the United States for seven years.  When she first left her
home in Estonia, she worked as a nanny to a family from Sweden, and then
traveled to the United States with them, first to Ann Arbor Michigan, and
then to California.  Shortly after she moved to Pacifica, she began working
as a nanny with a local family, which first brought her into contact with
Pacifica Co-op.  She also completed her associate of arts degree in Early
Childhood Education at Skyline College last year, and then found there was
an opening at the Pacifica Co-op.  She, too, was drawn to a program where
parents take an active and daily role.    She brings her youth, vitality,
and total commitment to working with both young children and their
families.

Diana reports that when she first interviewed for the position, she felt
she had not interviewed well, and was surprised to get a call offering her
the position.  The entire Co-op community was just hoping that she would
accept as she demonstrated all the characteristics of a fine teacher, with
an interest in working with the whole family.  Diana lives in Pacifica with
her husband and enjoys outdoor activities such as hiking and camping.  She
is continuing her education at San Francisco State University as well.

Central to the program at the Co-op has been the annual fundraiser,
Springfest.  Funds will help to support both the on-going program, and
necessary capital improvements.  On March 19, Springfest 2005 will take
place at the Community Center, 540 Crespi Drive, Pacifica, from 6:30 until
10:30 p.m.  It will include <a href="/springfest">silent and live auctions</a>, wine tasting, and
hearty hors d'oeuvres.  Tickets are $25 and attendees must be at least 21
years of age.  Ticket information is available at (650) 355-3272, or on-
line at www.pacificacoop.org.   This has traditionally been a lively
evening of entertainment, fine food, and a chance to support what is surely
a local treasure.  It is also an opportunity to meet Teachers Sandy,
Catherine, and Diana, and to thank them personally for all they do for our
children.
