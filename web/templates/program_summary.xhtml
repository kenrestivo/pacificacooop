    <p>The goal here is that you, the chairperson of the Program Committee, can copy and paste directly from this report into this year's Program. Or you can Save As... from the File menu of your browser, and save this as an HTML document, and then open it up from within just about any program. From there, you can change the font and do some more reformatting. The <a href="#Packages">Packages</a> and <a href="#Sponsors">Sponsors</a> are correct and accurate and should have been reviewed and maintained by the Packaging and Solicitation committees. The <a href="#Ads">Ads</a> are listed at the bottom of this report, obviously you'll have to actually cut and paste ad copy and scans of actual artwork for that part.</p>
