    How to print these pages:
    <ul>
      <li> Before printing, turn off the headers and footers in your browser. Choose 'Page Setup' from your 'File' menu, and in the 'Margins &amp; Header/Footer' section, clear out all the junk in 'Headers &amp; Footers'-- set it to blank.<br />    <img src="/images/setting-margin-small.png" alt="page setup for firefox" /><br />
    Sample Page Setup box for Firefox, correctly configured.
</li>
      <li>Choose 'Page Preview' from your File menu to see what it'll look like printed.</li>
      <li>The footer will automatically appear at the bottom of each page when printed.</li>
      <li>Page Preview is the best way to view how these print. Viewing in the regular browser mode doesn't give a clear picture of what the printouts will look like; Page Preview does.</li>
      <li>Put paper in your printer and print away!</li>
      <li>If you run into trouble using Explorer, try with <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com">Firefox</a></li>
      <li>This page and everything in it is just a series of HTML templates which can be modified by a web designer. Just ask for the template, modify it, and then have the new template uploaded.</li>
    </ul>
