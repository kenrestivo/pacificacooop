    How to print these sheets:
    <ul>
      <li> Before printing, turn off the headers and footers in your browser. Choose 'Page Setup' from your 'File' menu, and in the 'Margins &amp; Header/Footer' section, clear out all the junk in 'Headers &amp; Footers'-- set it to blank.</li>
      <li>You can also reduce the size of the margins in 'Page Setup', if you want try to squeeze more stuff on one page.</li>
      <li>Choose 'Page Preview' from your File menu to see what it'll look like printed.</li>
      <li>The footer will automatically appear at the bottom of each page when printed.</li>
      <li>This will probably look awful on screen. Don't panic; use Page Preview instead to see how it wil print</li>
      <li>Put paper in your printer and print away!</li>
      <li>This page and everything in it is just an HTML template which can be modified by any competent web designer you want it changed. Just ask.</li>
    </ul>
