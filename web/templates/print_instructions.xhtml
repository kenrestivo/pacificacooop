    How to print these pages:
    <ul>
      <li> Before printing, turn off the headers and footers in your browser. Choose 'Page Setup' from your 'File' menu, and in the 'Margins &amp; Header/Footer' section, clear out all the junk in 'Headers &amp; Footers'-- set it to blank.<br />    <img src="/images/setting-margin-small.png" alt="page setup for firefox" /><br />
    Sample Page Setup box for Firefox, correctly configured.
</li>
      <li>You can also reduce the size of the margins in 'Page Setup', if you want try to squeeze more stuff on one page.</li>
      <li>Choose 'Page Preview' from your File menu to see what it'll look like printed.</li>
      <li>The footer will automatically appear at the bottom of each page when printed.</li>
      <li>If you scroll down here, the sheets will probably look awful on screen. Don't panic; instead use Page Preview instead to see how they print.</li>
      <li>Put paper in your printer and print away!</li>
      <li>If you run into trouble using Explorer, try with <a href="http://www.getfirefox.com">Firefox</a></li>
      <li>This page and everything in it is just an HTML template which can be modified by any competent web designer you want it changed. Just ask.</li>
