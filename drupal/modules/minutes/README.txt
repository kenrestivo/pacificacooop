This module adds a "minutes" datatype which can be attached
to any event (as defined by event.module).  Minutes can only
be created with reference to a particular event.  Minutes track
which users attended the event.

If you have the excluded_users module installed, this module
will make use of it.

This module was developed for the MGH Biostatistics Center.

Please send any suggestions / improvements / problems to

Please include 'Drupal' and 'minutes' somewhere in the subject
header.
