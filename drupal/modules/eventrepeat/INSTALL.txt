TO INSTALL:
Note: It is assumed that you have Drupal up and running.  Be sure to
check the Drupal web site if you need assistance.  If you run into
problems, you should always read the INSTALL.txt that comes with the
Drupal package and read the online documentation.

:Preparing for Installation:

Note: Backing up your database is a very good idea before you begin!

1. Place the eventrepeat package into your Drupal modules/ directory.

2. Enable the eventrepeat module by navigating to: administer > modules

	Note: you must also install and enable the event package, as 
              eventrepeat depends on it!

   Click the 'Save configuration' button at the bottom to commit your
   changes.

3. Drupal will then try to install the database tables for the module automatically.
   MySQL or PostgreSQL are supported for automatic installation.  If you are not using
   either of these databases, or there are errors in the automatic install, you will have
   to install the database tables by hand. You can get a list of the necessary table queries
   from the eventrepeat.install file located in the eventrepeat module folder.

4. For the final configuration of the module, navigate to
   administer > settings > eventrepeat

   Here you can configure the options for the module.

5. In order for repeating events to be created for a node type, you must first 
   configure that node type to be enabled for repeating events. Enable the node 
   types that you wish to allow repeating events for under

   administer > settings > content types > configure

   While you're in the configuration settings screen, also make sure that
   the node type is set to be visible in the event calendar--otherwise
   eventrepeat will not work properly on that node type

   You may wish to create a new content type if it seems appropriate.

6. To enable users to create repeat events, set the 'create repeat events' permission for all applicable roles.  This can be found at administer > access control

7. You must have cron running on your site (and be visiting your site's cron.php
   page) for eventrepeat to work properly, and it's suggested that the cron runs
   happen at least twice a day.

7. Visit your site's administer->help->eventrepeat for details on how to begin 
   creating repeating events.
